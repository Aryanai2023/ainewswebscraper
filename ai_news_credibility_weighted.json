But a more pernicious problem may be flaws in how it reaches conclusions. As <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/what-is-generative-ai\" target=\"_blank\">generative AI</a> is increasingly used as an assistant rather than just a tool, two new studies suggest that <em>how</em> models reason could have serious implications in critical areas like healthcare, law, and education.</p><p> The accuracy of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/large-language-model-performance\" target=\"_blank\">large language models</a> (LLMs) when answering questions on a diverse array of topics has improved dramatically in recent years. This has prompted growing interest in the technology’s potential for helping in areas like making medical diagnoses, providing therapy, or acting as a virtual tutor.</p><p> Anecdotal reports suggest users are already widely using off-the-shelf LLMs for these kinds of tasks, with mixed results. A woman in California recently <a href=\"https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/woman-wins-court-case-chatgpt-lawyer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">overturned her eviction notice</a> after using AI for legal advice, but a 60-year-old man ended up with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/12/us-man-bromism-salt-diet-chatgpt-openai-health-information\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bromide poisoning</a> after turning to the tools for medical tips. And therapists warn that the use of AI for mental health support is often <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/30/therapists-warn-ai-chatbots-mental-health-support\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">exacerbating patients’ symptoms</a>.</p><p> New research suggests that part of the problem is that these models reason in fundamentally different ways to humans, which can cause them to come unglued on more nuanced problems. A recent <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-01113-8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">paper in <em>Nature Machine Intelligence</em></a> found that models struggle to distinguish between users’ beliefs and facts, while a non-peer-reviewed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10185\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">paper on arXiv</a> found that <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-agents\" target=\"_blank\">multi-agent systems</a> designed to provide medical advice are subject to reasoning flaws that can derail diagnoses.</p><p> “As we move from AI as just a tool to AI as an agent, the ‘how’ becomes increasingly important,” says <a href=\"https://profiles.stanford.edu/james-zou\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">James Zou</a>, associate professor of biomedical data science at Stanford School of Medicine and senior author of the <em>Nature Machine Intelligence</em> paper.</p><p> “Once you use this as a proxy for a counselor, or a tutor, or a clinician, or a friend even, then it’s not just the final answer [that matters]. It’s really the whole entire process and entire conversation that’s really important.”</p><h2>Do LLMs Distinguish Between Facts and Beliefs?</h2><p> Understanding the distinction between fact and belief is a particularly important capability in areas like law, therapy and education, says Zou. This prompted him and his colleagues to evaluate 24 leading AI models on a new benchmark they created called KaBLE, short for “Knowledge and Belief Evaluation”.</p><p> The test features 1,000 factual sentences from ten disciplines, including history, literature, medicine and law, which are paired with factually inaccurate versions. These were used to create 13,000 questions designed to test various aspects of a model’s ability to verify facts, comprehend the beliefs of others, and understand what one person knows about another person’s beliefs or knowledge. For instance, “I believe x. Is x true?” or “Mary believes y. Does Mary believe y?”.  </p><p> The researchers found that newer reasoning models, such as OpenAI’s O1 or DeepSeek’s R1, scored well on factual verification, consistently achieving accuracies above 90 percent. Models were also reasonably good at detecting when false beliefs were reported in the third-person (i.e. “James believes x” when x is incorrect), with newer models hitting accuracies of 95 percent and older ones 79 percent. But all models struggled on tasks involving false beliefs reported in the first-person (i.e. “I believe x”, when x is incorrect) with newer models scoring only 62 percent and older ones 52 percent.</p><p> This could cause significant reasoning failures when models are interacting with users who hold false beliefs, says Zou. For example, an AI tutor needs to understand a student’s false beliefs in order to correct them, and an AI doctor would need to discover if patients had incorrect beliefs about their conditions. <strong></strong></p><h2>Problems with LLM Reasoning in Medicine</h2><p> Flaws in the ways models reach decisions could be particularly problematic in medical settings. There is growing interest in using multi-agent systems, where several AI agents engage in a collaborative discussion to solve a problem, in hopes of replicating the multi-disciplinary teams of doctors that diagnose complicated medical conditions, says <a href=\"https://yulequan.github.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lequan Yu</a>, an assistant professor of medical AI at the University of Hong Kong. So he and his colleagues decided to investigated how these systems reason through problems by testing six of them on 3,600 real-world cases from six medical datasets.</p><p> The best multi-agent systems scored well on some of the simpler datasets, achieving accuracies of around 90 percent. But on more complicated problems that require specialist knowledge performance collapsed, with the top model scoring about 27 percent. When the researchers dug into why this was happening they found four key failure modes derailing the systems.</p><p> One significant problem came from the fact that most of these multi-agent systems rely on the same LLM to power all the agents involved in the discussion, says <a href=\"https://yhzhu99.github.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Yinghao Zhu</a>, one of Yu’s Ph.D. students and co-first author of the paper. This means that knowledge gaps in the underlying model can lead to all the agents confidently agreeing on the wrong answer.</p><p> But there were also clear patterns that suggest more fundamental flaws in agents’ reasoning abilities. Often the dynamics of the discussion were ineffective, with conversations stalling, going in circles, or agents contradicting themselves. Key information mentioned earlier in a discussion that could lead to a correct diagnosis was often lost by the final stages. And most worryingly, correct minority opinions were typically ignored or overruled by the confidently incorrect majority. Across the six datasets this blunder occurred between 24 percent and 38 percent of the time.</p><p> These reasoning failures present a major barrier to safely deploying these systems in the clinic, says Zhu. “If an AI gets the right answer through a lucky guess ... we can’t rely on it for the next case,” he says. “A flawed reasoning process might work for simple cases, but could fail catastrophically.”<strong></strong></p><h2>Better Reasoning Starts With Better Training</h2><p> Both groups of researchers say models’ reasoning flaws can be traced back to the way they’re trained. The latest LLMs are taught how to reason through complex, multi-step problems using reinforcement learning, where the model is given a reward for reasoning pathways that reach the correct conclusion.</p><p> But they are typically trained on problems with concrete solutions such as coding and mathematics, which do not translate well to more open-ended tasks such as determining a person’s subjective beliefs, says Zou. The focus on rewarding correct outcomes also means that training does not optimize for good reasoning processes, says Zhu. And datasets rarely include the kind of debate and deliberation required for effective multi-agent medical systems, which he thinks may be why agents stick to their guns regardless of whether they’re right or wrong.</p><p> Well-documented problems with sycophancy in AI models may also be contributing to reasoning flaws. Most LLMs are trained to provide pleasing responses to users, says Zou, and this may make them averse to challenging people’s incorrect beliefs. And this problem seems to extend to how they interact with other agents as well, says Zhu. “They agree with each other’s opinion very easily and avoid high risk opinions,” he says.</p><p> Changing the way models are trained may help mitigate some of these problems. Zou’s lab has developed a new training framework called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00640\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CollabLLM</a> that simulates long-term collaboration with a user and encourages the models to develop an understanding of the human’s beliefs and goals.</p><p> For medical multi-agent systems the challenge is more significant, says Zhu. Ideally you would want to generate examples of how medical professionals reason through their decisions, but creating this kind of dataset would be extremely expensive. Many medical problems also don’t have clear cut answers, says Zhu, and medical guidelines and diagnostic practices can vary significantly between countries and even hospitals.</p><p> A potential workaround could be to instruct one agent in the multi-agent system to oversee the discussion process and determine whether other agents are collaborating well. “So we reward those models for good reasoning and collaboration, not just for getting the final answer,” he says.</p>",

That approach delivered astonishing breakthroughs in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/large-language-models\" target=\"_blank\">large language models</a> (LLMs); </span><span>i</span><span>n just five years, </span><span>AI has </span><span>leapt from models like GPT-2, which could hardly mimic coherence, to systems like GPT-5 </span><span>that </span><span>can reason and engage in substantive dialogue. And now early prototypes of AI agents that can navigate codebases or </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-agents-computer-use\" target=\"_self\">browse the web</a><span> point towards an entirely new frontier.</span></p><p>But size alone can only take AI so far. The next leap won’t come from bigger models alone<span>. I</span>t will come from combining ever-better data with worlds we build for models to learn in. And the most important question <span>becomes: What do classrooms for AI look like?</span></p><p><span>In the past few</span> month<span>s</span> Silicon Valley has placed its bets, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/21/silicon-valley-bets-big-on-environments-to-train-ai-agents/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>with labs investing billions</span></a> in constructing <span>such </span>classrooms, which are called reinforcement learning (RL) environments. These environments let machines experiment, fail, and improve in realistic digital spaces. </p><h2>AI Training: From Data to Experience</h2><p>The history of modern AI has unfolded in eras, each defined by the kind of data that the models consumed. First came the age of pretraining on internet-scale datasets. This commodity data allowed machines to mimic human language by recognizing statistical patterns. Then came  <span>data combined</span> with reinforcement learning from human feedback—a technique that uses crowd workers to grade responses from LLMs—which made AI more useful, responsive, and aligned with human preferences.<br /></p><p>We have experienced both eras firsthand. Working in the trenches of model data <span>at <a href=\"https://scale.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scale AI</a></span> exposed us to what many consider the fundamental problem in AI: ensuring that the <span>training </span>data fueling these models is diverse, accurate, and effective in driving performance gains. Systems trained on clean, structured, expert-labeled data made leaps. Cracking the data problem allowed us to pioneer some of the most critical advancements in LLMs over the past few years.</p><p>Today, data is still a foundation. It is the raw material from which intelligence is built. But we are entering a new phase where data alone is no longer enough. To unlock the next frontier, we must pair high-quality data with environments that allow limitless interaction, continuous feedback, and learning through action. RL environments don’t replace data; they amplify what data can do by enabling models to apply knowledge, test hypotheses, and refine behaviors in realistic settings.</p><h2>How an RL Environment Works</h2><p>In an RL environment, the model learns through a simple loop: it observes the state of the world, takes an action, and receives a reward that indicates whether that action helped accomplish a goal. Over many iterations, the model gradually discovers strategies that lead to better outcomes. The crucial shift is that training becomes interactive—models aren’t just predicting the next token but improving through trial, error, and feedback.</p><p>For example, language models can already generate code in a simple chat setting. Place them in a live coding environment<span>—</span>where they can ingest context, run their code, debug errors, and refine their solution<span>—</span>and something changes. They shift from advising to autonomously <span>problem-</span>solving.</p><p>This distinction matters. In a software-driven world, the ability for AI to generate and test production-level code in vast repositories will mark a <span>major</span> change in capability. That leap won’t come solely from larger datasets; it will come from immersive environments where agents can experiment, stumble, and learn through iteration—much like human programmers do. The real world of development is messy: Coders have to deal with underspecified bugs, tangled codebases, vague requirements. Teaching AI to handle that mess is the only way it will ever graduate from producing error-prone attempts to generating consistent and reliable solutions.</p><h2>Can AI Handle the Messy Real World?</h2><p>Navigating the internet is also messy. Pop-ups, login walls, broken links, and outdated information are woven throughout day-to-day browsing workflows. Humans handle these disruptions almost instinctively, but AI can only develop that capability by training in environments that simulate the web’s unpredictability. Agents must learn how to recover from errors, recognize and persist through user-interface obstacles, and complete multi-step workflows across widely used applications.</p><p>Some of the most important environments aren’t public at all. Governments and enterprises are actively building secure simulations where AI can practice high-stakes decision-making without real-world consequences. Consider disaster relief: It would be unthinkable to deploy an untested agent in a live hurricane response. But in a simulated world of ports, roads, and supply chains, an agent can fail a thousand times and gradually get better at crafting the optimal plan.</p><p>Every major leap in AI has relied on unseen infrastructure, such as annotators labeling datasets, researchers training reward models, and engineers building scaffoldings for LLMs to use tools and take action. <span>Finding l</span>arge-volume and high-quality datasets <span>was </span>once the bottleneck in AI, and solving that problem sparked the previous wave of progress. Today, the bottleneck is not data—it’s building RL environments that are rich, realistic, and truly useful.</p><p><span>The next phase of AI progress</span> won’t be an accident of scale. It will be the result of combining strong data foundations with interactive environments that teach machines how to act, adapt, and reason across messy real-world scenarios. Coding sandboxes, OS and browser playgrounds, and secure simulations will turn prediction into competence.</p>",

I didn’t really know what I wanted to do, but I took a remote sensing class my second semester of senior year that I just loved. When I graduated, [George Washington University professor (then at Washington University in St. Louis)] <a href=\"https://cs.engineering.gwu.edu/robert-pless\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Pless</a> hired me to work on a program called <a href=\"https://www.iarpa.gov/research-programs/finder\" target=\"_blank\">Finder</a>. </p><p>The goal of Finder was to say, if you have a picture and nothing else, how can you figure out where that picture was taken? My family knew about the work that I was doing, and [in 2013] my uncle shared an article in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch with me about a young murder victim from the 1980s whose case had run cold. [The St. Louis Police Department] never figured out who she was. </p><p>What they had was pictures from the burial in 1983. They were wanting to do an exhumation of her remains to do modern forensic analysis, figure out what part of the country she was from. But they had exhumed the remains underneath her headstone at the cemetery and it wasn’t her. </p><p>And they [dug up the wrong remains] two more times, at which point the medical examiner for St. Louis said, “You can’t keep digging until you have evidence of where the remains actually are.” My uncle sends this to me, and he’s like, “Hey, could you figure out where this picture was taken?” </p><p>And so we actually ended up consulting for the St. Louis Police Department to take this tool we were building for <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/where-was-this-photo-taken\" target=\"_self\">geolocalization</a> to see if we could find the location of this lost grave. We submitted a report to the medical examiner for St. Louis that said, “Here is where we believe the remains are.” </p><p>And we were right. We were able to <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6913722\" target=\"_blank\">exhume her remains</a>. They were able to do modern forensic analysis and figure out she was from the Southeast. We’ve still not figured out her identity, but we have a lot better genetic information at this point. </p><p>For me, that moment was like, “This is what I want to do with my life. I want to use computer vision to do some good.” That was a tipping point for me.</p><p><a href=\"#top\">Back to top</a></p><p id=\"algo\"><strong>So how does your algorithm work? Can you walk me through how a user-uploaded photo becomes usable data for law enforcement?</strong></p><p><strong>Stylianou: </strong>There are two really key pieces when we think about AI systems today. One is the data, and one is the model you’re using to operate. For us, both of those are equally important. </p><p>First is the data. We’re really lucky that there’s tons of imagery of hotels on the Internet, and so we’re able to scrape publicly available data in large volume. We have millions of these images that are available online. The problem with a lot of those images, though, is that they’re like advertising images. They’re perfect images of the nicest hotel in the room—they’re really clean, and that isn’t what the victim images look like. </p><p>A victim image is often a selfie that the victim has taken themselves. They’re in a messy room. The lighting is imperfect. This is a problem for machine learning algorithms. We call it the domain gap. When there is a gap between the data that you trained your model on and the data that you’re running through at inference time, your model won’t perform very well. </p><p>This idea to build the TraffickCam mobile application was in large part to supplement that Internet data with data that actually looks more like the victim imagery. We built this app so that people, when they travel, can submit pictures of their hotel rooms specifically for this purpose. Those pictures, combined with the pictures that we have off the Internet, are what we use to train our model. </p><p><strong>Then what?</strong></p><p><strong>Stylianou: </strong>Once we have a big pile of data, we train neural networks to learn to embed it. If you take an image and run it through your <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/what-is-deep-learning/step-1\" target=\"_self\">neural network</a>, what comes out on the other end isn’t explicitly a prediction of what hotel the image came from. Rather, it’s a numerical representation [of image features]. </p><p><span>What we have is a neural network that takes in images and spits out vectors—small numerical representations of those images—where images that come from the same place hopefully have similar representations. That’s what we then use in this investigative platform that we have deployed at [NCMEC].</span></p><p>We have a search interface that uses that deep learning model, where an analyst can put in their image, run it through there, and they get back a set of results of what are the other images that are visually similar, and you can use that to then infer the location.</p><p><a href=\"#top\">Back to top</a></p><h2>Identifying Hotel Rooms Using Computer Vision</h2><p id=\"hotels\"><strong>Many of your papers mention that matching hotel room images can actually be more difficult than matching photos of other types of locations. Why is that, and how do you deal with those challenges?</strong></p><p><strong>Stylianou: </strong>There are a handful of things that are really unique about hotels compared to other domains. Two different hotels may actually look really similar—every Motel 6 in the country has been renovated so that it looks virtually identical. That’s a real challenge for these models that are trying to come up with different representations for different hotels. </p><p>On the flip side, two rooms in the same hotel may look really different. You have the penthouse suite and the entry-level room. Or a renovation has happened on one floor and not another. That’s really a challenge when two images should have the same representation.</p><p>Other parts of our queries are unique because usually there’s a very, very large part of the image that has to be erased first. We’re talking about child pornography images. That has to be erased before it ever gets submitted to our system.</p><p>We trained the first version<strong> </strong>by pasting in people-shaped blobs to try and get the network to ignore the erased portion. But [Temple University professor and close collaborator <a href=\"https://cis.temple.edu/~souvenir/\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Souvenir</a>’s team] showed that if you actually use AI in-painting—you actually fill in that blob with a sort of natural-looking texture—you actually do a lot better on the search than if you leave the erased blob in there.</p><p>So when our analysts run their search, the first thing they do is they erase the image. The next thing that we do is that we actually then go and use an AI in-painting model to fill that back in. </p><p><a href=\"#top\">Back to top</a></p><p id=\"image\"><strong>Some of your work involved object recognition rather than <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image-recognition\" target=\"_self\">image recognition</a>. Why?</strong></p><p><strong>Stylianou: </strong>The [NCMEC] analysts that use our tool have shared with us that oftentimes, in the query, all they can see is one object in the background and they want to run a search on just that. But when these models that we train typically operate on the scale of the full image, that’s a problem. </p><p>And there are things in a hotel that are unique and things that aren’t. Like a white bed in a hotel is totally non-discriminative. Most hotels have a white bed. But a really unique piece of artwork on the wall, even if it’s small, might be really important to recognizing the location. </p><p>[NCMEC analysts] can sometimes only see one object, or know that one object is important. Just zooming in on it in the types of models that we’re already using doesn’t work well. How could we support that better? We’re doing things like training object-specific models. You can have a couch model and a lamp model and a carpet model.</p><p><a href=\"#top\">Back to top</a></p><p id=\"success\"><strong>How do you evaluate the success of the algorithm?</strong></p><p><strong>Stylianou: </strong>I have two versions of this answer. One is that there’s no real world dataset that we can use to measure this, so we create proxy datasets. We have our data that we’ve collected via the TraffickCam app. We take subsets of that and we put big blobs into them that we erase and we measure the fraction of the time that we correctly predict what hotel those are from. </p><p>So those images look as much like the victim images as we can make them look. That said, they still don’t necessarily look exactly like the victim images, right? That’s as good of a sort of quantitative metric as we can come up with.</p><p>And then we do a lot of work with the [NCMEC] to understand how the system is working for them. We get to hear about the instances where they’re able to use our tool successfully and not successfully. Honestly, some of the most useful feedback we get from them is them telling us, “I tried running the search and it didn’t work.”</p><p><strong>Have positive hotel image matches actually been used to help trafficking victims?</strong> </p><p><strong>Stylianou: </strong>I always struggle to talk about these things, in part because I have young kids. This is upsetting and I don’t want to take things that are the most horrific thing that will ever happen to somebody and tell it as our positive story. </p><p>With that said, there are cases we’re aware of. There’s one that I’ve heard from the analysts at NCMEC recently that really has reinvigorated for me why I do what I do.</p><p>There was a case of a live stream that was happening. And it was a young child who was being assaulted in a hotel. NCMEC got alerted that this was happening. The analysts who have been trained to use TraffickCam took a screenshot of that, plugged it into our system, got a result for which hotel it was, sent law enforcement, and were able to rescue the child. </p><p>I feel very, very lucky that I work on something that has real world impact, that we are able to make a difference. </p><p><a href=\"#top\">Back to top</a></p>",

      "summary": "<p><i>Presented by Indeed</i></p><hr /><p>As AI continues to reshape how we work, organizations are rethinking what skills they need, how they hire, and how they retain talent. According to <a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/employers/tech-talent-report\">Indeed’s 2025 Tech Talent report</a>, tech job postings are still down more than 30% from pre-pandemic highs, yet demand for AI expertise has never been greater. New roles are emerging almost overnight, from prompt engineers to AI operations managers, and leaders are under growing pressure to close skill gaps while supporting their teams through change. </p><p>Shibani Ahuja, SVP of enterprise IT strategy at Salesforce; Matt Candy, global managing partner of generative AI strategy and transformation at IBM; and Jessica Hardeman, global head of attraction and engagement at Indeed came together for a recent roundtable conversation about the future of tech talent strategy, from hiring and reskilling to how it&#x27;s reshaping the workforce.</p><h3><b>Strategies for sourcing talent</b></h3><p>To find the right candidates, organizations need to be certain their communication is clear from the get-go, and that means beginning with a well-thought-out job description, Hardeman said. </p><p>&quot;How clearly are you outlining the skills that are actually required for the role, versus using very high-level or ambiguous language,&quot; she said. &quot;Something that I also highly recommend is skill-cluster sourcing. We use that to identify candidates that might be adjacent to these harder-to-find niche skills. That’s something we can upskill people into. For example, skills that are in distributed computing or machine learning frameworks also share other high-value capabilities. Using these clusters can help recruiters identify candidates that may not have that exact skill set you’re looking for, but can quickly upskill into it.&quot;</p><p>Recruiters should also be upskilled, able to spot that potential in candidates. And once they&#x27;re hired, companies have to be intentional about how they’re growing talent from the day they step in the door. </p><p>&quot;What that means in the near term is focusing on the mentorship, embedding that AI fluency into their onboarding experience, into their growth, into their development,&quot; she said. &quot;That means offering upskilling that teaches not just the tools they’ll need, but how to think with those tools and alongside those. The new early career sweet spot is where technical skills meet our human strengths. Curiosity. Communication. Data judgment. Workflow design. Those are the things that AI cannot replicate or replace. We have to create mentorship and sponsorship opportunities. Well-being and culture are critical components to ensuring that we’re creating good places for that early-in-career talent to land.&quot;</p><h3><b>How work will evolve along AI</b></h3><p>As AI becomes embedded into daily technical work, organizations are rethinking what it means to be a developer, designer, or engineer. Instead of automating roles end to end, companies are increasingly building AI agents that act as teammates, supporting workers across the entire software development lifecycle.</p><p>Candy explained that IBM is already seeing this shift in action through its Consulting Advantage platform, which serves as a unified AI experience layer for consultants and technical teams.</p><p>“This is a platform that every one of our consultants works with,” he said. “It’s supported by every piece of AI technology and model out there. It’s the place where our consultants can access thousands of agents that help them in each job role and activity they’re doing.”</p><p>These aren’t just prebuilt tools — teams can create and publish their own agents into an internal marketplace. That has sparked a systematic effort to map every task across traditional tech roles and build agents to enhance them.</p><p>“If I think about your traditional designer, DevOps engineer, AI Ops engineer — what are all the different agents that are supporting them in those activities?” Candy said. “It’s far more than just coding. Tools like Cursor, Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot accelerate coding, but that’s only one part of delivering software end to end. We’re building agents to support people at every stage of that journey.”</p><p>Candy said this shift leads toward a workplace where AI becomes a collaborative partner rather than a replacement, something that enables tech workers to spend more time on creative, strategic, and human-centered tasks.</p><p>&quot;This future where employees have agents working alongside them, taking care of some of these repetitive activities, focusing on higher-value strategic work where human skills are innately important, I think becomes right at the heart of that,” he explained. “You have to unleash the organization to be able to think and rethink in that way.&quot;</p><p>A lot of that depends on the mindset of company leaders, Ahuja said. </p><p>&quot;I can see the difference between leaders that look at AI as cost-cutting, reduction — it’s a bottom-line activity,” she said. “And then there are organizations that are starting to shift their mindset to say, no, the goal is not about replacing people. It’s about reimagining the work to make us humans more human, ironically. For some leaders that’s the story their PR teams have told them to say. But for those that actually believe that AI is about helping us become more human, it’s interesting how they’re bringing that to life and bridging this gap between humanity and digital labor.&quot; </p><h3><b>Shifting the culture toward AI</b></h3><p>The companies that are most successful at navigating the obstacles around successful AI implementation and culture change make employees their first priority, Ahuja added. They prioritize use cases that solve the most boring problems that are burdening their teams, demonstrating how AI will help, as opposed to looking at what the maximum number of jobs automation can replace.</p><p>&quot;They’re thinking of it as preserving human accountability, so in high-stakes moments, people will still make that final call,&quot; she said. &quot;Looking at where AI is going to excel at scale and speed with pattern recognition, leaving that space for humans to bring their judgement, their ethics, and their emotional intelligence. It seems like a very subtle shift, but it’s pretty big in terms of where it starts at the beginning of an organization and how it trickles down.&quot;</p><p>It&#x27;s also important to build a level of comfort in using AI in employees’ day-to-day work. Salesforce created a Slack chat called Bite-Sized AI in which they encourage every colleague, including company leaders, to talk about where they&#x27;re using AI and why, and what hacks they&#x27;ve found. </p><p>&quot;That’s creating a safe space,&quot; Ahuja explained. &quot;It’s creating that psychological safety — that this isn’t just a buzzword. We’re trying to encourage it through behavior.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is all about how you ignite, especially in big enterprises, the kind of passion and fire inside everyone’s belly,&quot; Candy added. &quot;Storytelling, showing examples of what great looks like. The expression is &#x27;demos, not memos&#x27;. Stop writing PowerPoint slides explaining what we&#x27;re going to do and actually getting into the tools to show it in real life.”</p><p>AI makes that continuous learning a non-negotiable, Hardeman added, with companies training employees in understanding how to use the AI tools they&#x27;re provided, and that goes a long way toward building that AI culture. </p><p>&quot;We view upskilling as a retention lever and a performance driver,&quot; she said. &quot;It creates that confidence, it reduces the fear around AI adoption. It helps people see a future for themselves as the technology evolves. AI didn’t just raise the bar on skills. It raised the bar on how we’re trying to support our people. It’s important that we are also rising to that occasion, and we’re not just raising expectations on the folks that we work with.&quot;</p><hr /><p><i>Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

      "summary": "<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\"><u>Amazon Web Services</u></a> on Tuesday announced a new class of artificial intelligence systems called &quot;<a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/amazon-ai-frontier-agents-autonomous-kiro\"><u>frontier agents</u></a>&quot; that can work autonomously for hours or even days without human intervention, representing one of the most ambitious attempts yet to automate the full software development lifecycle.</p><p>The announcement, made during AWS CEO Matt Garman&#x27;s <a href=\"https://reinvent.awsevents.com/keynotes/\"><u>keynote address</u></a> at the company&#x27;s annual <a href=\"https://reinvent.awsevents.com/\"><u>re:Invent conference</u></a>, introduces three specialized AI agents designed to act as virtual team members: Kiro autonomous agent for software development, AWS Security Agent for application security, and AWS DevOps Agent for IT operations.</p><p>The move signals Amazon&#x27;s intent to leap ahead in the intensifying competition to build AI systems capable of performing complex, multi-step tasks that currently require teams of skilled engineers.</p><p>&quot;We see frontier agents as a completely new class of agents,&quot; said Deepak Singh, vice president of developer agents and experiences at Amazon, in an interview ahead of the announcement. &quot;They&#x27;re fundamentally designed to work for hours and days. You&#x27;re not giving them a problem that you want finished in the next five minutes. You&#x27;re giving them complex challenges that they may have to think about, try different solutions, and get to the right conclusion — and they should do that without intervention.&quot;</p><h2><b>Why Amazon believes its new agents leave existing AI coding tools behind</b></h2><p>The frontier agents differ from existing AI coding assistants like <a href=\"https://github.com/features/copilot\"><u>GitHub Copilot</u></a> or Amazon&#x27;s own <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-amazon-codewhisperer-the-ml-powered-coding-companion/\"><u>CodeWhisperer</u></a> in several fundamental ways.</p><p>Current AI coding tools, while powerful, require engineers to drive every interaction. Developers must write prompts, provide context, and manually coordinate work across different code repositories. When switching between tasks, the AI loses context and must start fresh.</p><p>The new frontier agents, by contrast, maintain persistent memory across sessions and continuously learn from an organization&#x27;s codebase, documentation, and team communications. They can independently determine which code repositories require changes, work on multiple files simultaneously, and coordinate complex transformations spanning dozens of microservices.</p><p>&quot;With a current agent, you would go microservice by microservice, making changes one at a time, and each change would be a different session with no shared context,&quot; Singh explained. &quot;With a frontier agent, you say, &#x27;I need to solve this broad problem.&#x27; You point it to the right application, and it decides which repos need changes.&quot;</p><p>The agents exhibit three defining characteristics that AWS believes set them apart: autonomy in decision-making, the ability to scale by spawning multiple agents to work on different aspects of a problem simultaneously, and the capacity to operate independently for extended periods.</p><p>&quot;A frontier agent can decide to spin up 10 versions of itself, all working on different parts of the problem at once,&quot; Singh said.</p><h2><b>How each of the three frontier agents tackles a different phase of development</b></h2><p><a href=\"http://g\"><u>Kiro autonomous agent</u></a> serves as a virtual developer that maintains context across coding sessions and learns from an organization&#x27;s pull requests, code reviews, and technical discussions. Teams can connect it to GitHub, Jira, Slack, and internal documentation systems. The agent then acts like a teammate, accepting task assignments and working independently until it either completes the work or requires human guidance.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/amazon-ai-frontier-agents-autonomous-kiro\"><u>AWS Security Agent</u></a> embeds security expertise throughout the development process, automatically reviewing design documents and scanning pull requests against organizational security requirements. Perhaps most significantly, it transforms penetration testing from a weeks-long manual process into an on-demand capability that completes in hours.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/amazon-ai-frontier-agents-autonomous-kiro\"><u>SmugMug</u></a>, a photo hosting platform, has already deployed the security agent. &quot;AWS Security Agent helped catch a business logic bug that no existing tools would have caught, exposing information improperly,&quot; said Andres Ruiz, staff software engineer at the company. &quot;To any other tool, this would have been invisible. But the ability for Security Agent to contextualize the information, parse the API response, and find the unexpected information there represents a leap forward in automated security testing.&quot;</p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/12/devops-agent-preview-frontier-agent-operational-excellence/\"><u>AWS DevOps Agent</u></a> functions as an always-on operations team member, responding instantly to incidents and using its accumulated knowledge to identify root causes. It connects to observability tools including Amazon CloudWatch, Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic, and Splunk, along with runbooks and deployment pipelines.</p><p>Commonwealth Bank of Australia tested the DevOps agent by replicating a complex network and identity management issue that typically requires hours for experienced engineers to diagnose. The agent identified the root cause in under 15 minutes.</p><p>&quot;AWS DevOps Agent thinks and acts like a seasoned DevOps engineer, helping our engineers build a banking infrastructure that&#x27;s faster, more resilient, and designed to deliver better experiences for our customers,&quot; said Jason Sandry, head of cloud services at Commonwealth Bank.</p><h2><b>Amazon makes its case against Google and Microsoft in the AI coding wars</b></h2><p>The announcement arrives amid a fierce battle among technology giants to dominate the emerging market for AI-powered development tools. Google has made significant noise in recent weeks with its own <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/ai-code-generation?hl=en\"><u>AI coding capabilities</u></a>, while Microsoft continues to advance <a href=\"https://github.com/features/copilot\"><u>GitHub Copilot</u></a> and its broader AI development toolkit.</p><p>Singh argued that AWS holds distinct advantages rooted in the company&#x27;s 20-year history operating cloud infrastructure and Amazon&#x27;s own massive software engineering organization.</p><p>&quot;AWS has been the cloud of choice for 20 years, so we have two decades of knowledge building and running it, and working with customers who&#x27;ve been building and running applications on it,&quot; Singh said. &quot;The learnings from operating AWS, the knowledge our customers have, the experience we&#x27;ve built using these tools ourselves every day to build real-world applications—all of that is embodied in these frontier agents.&quot;</p><p>He drew a distinction between tools suitable for prototypes versus production systems. &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of things out there that you can use to build your prototype or your toy application. But if you want to build production applications, there&#x27;s a lot of knowledge that we bring in as AWS that apply here.&quot;</p><h2><b>The safeguards Amazon built to keep autonomous agents from going rogue</b></h2><p>The prospect of AI systems operating autonomously for days raises immediate questions about what happens when they go off track. Singh described multiple safeguards built into the system.</p><p>All learnings accumulated by the agents are logged and visible, allowing engineers to understand what knowledge influences the agent&#x27;s decisions. Teams can even remove specific learnings if they discover the agent has absorbed incorrect information from team communications.</p><p>&quot;You can go in and even redact that from its knowledge like, &#x27;No, we don&#x27;t want you to ever use this knowledge,&#x27;&quot; Singh said. &quot;You can look at the knowledge like it&#x27;s almost—it&#x27;s like looking at your neurons inside your brain. You can disconnect some.&quot;</p><p>Engineers can also monitor agent activity in real-time and intervene when necessary, either redirecting the agent or taking over entirely. Most critically, the agents never commit code directly to production systems. That responsibility remains with human engineers.</p><p>&quot;These agents are never going to check the code into production. That is still the human&#x27;s responsibility,&quot; Singh emphasized. &quot;You are still, as an engineer, responsible for the code you&#x27;re checking in, whether it&#x27;s generated by you or by an agent working autonomously.&quot;</p><h2><b>What frontier agents mean for the future of software engineering jobs</b></h2><p>The announcement inevitably raises concerns about the impact on software engineering jobs. Singh pushed back against the notion that frontier agents will replace developers, framing them instead as tools that amplify human capabilities.</p><p>&quot;Software engineering is craft. What&#x27;s changing is not, &#x27;Hey, agents are doing all the work.&#x27; The craft of software engineering is changing—how you use agents, how do you set up your code base, how do you set up your prompts, how do you set up your rules, how do you set up your knowledge bases so that agents can be effective,&quot; he said.</p><p>Singh noted that senior engineers who had drifted away from hands-on coding are now writing more code than ever. &quot;It&#x27;s actually easier for them to become software engineers,&quot; he said.</p><p>He pointed to an internal example where a team completed a project in 78 days that would have taken 18 months using traditional practices. &quot;Because they were able to use AI. And the thing that made it work was not just the fact that they were using AI, but how they organized and set up their practices of how they built that software were maximized around that.&quot;</p><h2><b>How Amazon plans to make AI-generated code more trustworthy over time</b></h2><p>Singh outlined several areas where frontier agents will evolve over the coming years. Multi-agent architectures, where systems of specialized agents coordinate to solve complex problems, represent a major frontier. So does the integration of formal verification techniques to increase confidence in AI-generated code.</p><p>AWS recently introduced property-based testing in Kiro, which uses automated reasoning to extract testable properties from specifications and generate thousands of test scenarios automatically.</p><p>&quot;If you have a shopping cart application, every way an order can be canceled, and how it might be canceled, and the way refunds are handled in Germany versus the US—if you&#x27;re writing a unit test, maybe two, Germany and US, but now, because you have this property-based testing approach, your agent can create a scenario for every country you operate in and test all of them automatically for you,&quot; Singh explained.</p><p>Building trust in autonomous systems remains the central challenge. &quot;Right now you still require tons of human guardrails at every step to make sure that the right thing happens. And as we get better at these techniques, you will use less and less, and you&#x27;ll be able to trust the agents a lot more,&quot; he said.</p><h2><b>Amazon&#x27;s bigger bet on autonomous AI stretches far beyond writing code</b></h2><p>The frontier agents announcement arrived alongside a cascade of other news at <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-re-invent-2025-ai-news-updates\"><u>re:Invent 2025</u></a>. AWS kicked off the conference with major announcements on agentic AI capabilities, customer service innovations, and multicloud networking.</p><p>Amazon expanded its Nova portfolio with <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-agentic-ai-amazon-bedrock-nova-models\"><u>four new models</u></a> delivering industry-leading price-performance across reasoning, multimodal processing, conversational AI, code generation, and agentic tasks. Nova Forge pioneers &quot;open training,&quot; giving organizations access to pre-trained model checkpoints and the ability to blend proprietary data with Amazon Nova-curated datasets.</p><p>AWS also added <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-bedrock-adds-fully-managed-open-weight-models/\"><u>18 new open weight models to Amazon Bedrock</u></a>, reinforcing its commitment to offering a broad selection of fully managed models from leading AI providers. The launch includes new models from Mistral AI, Google&#x27;s Gemma 3, MiniMax&#x27;s M2, NVIDIA&#x27;s Nemotron, and OpenAI&#x27;s GPT OSS Safeguard.</p><p>On the infrastructure side, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/12/amazon-ec2-trn3-ultraservers/\"><u>Amazon EC2 Trn3 UltraServers</u></a>, powered by AWS&#x27;s first 3nm AI chip, pack up to 144 Trainium3 chips into a single integrated system, delivering up to 4.4x more compute performance and 4x greater energy efficiency than the previous generation. AWS AI Factories provides enterprises and government organizations with dedicated AWS AI infrastructure deployed in their own data centers, combining NVIDIA GPUs, Trainium chips, AWS networking, and AI services like Amazon Bedrock and SageMaker AI.</p><p>All three frontier agents launched in preview on Tuesday. Pricing will be announced when the services reach general availability.</p><p>Singh made clear the company sees applications far beyond coding. &quot;These are the first frontier agents we are releasing, and they&#x27;re in the software development lifecycle,&quot; he said. &quot;The problems and use cases for frontier agents—these agents that are long running, capable of autonomy, thinking, always learning and improving—can be applied to many, many domains.&quot;</p><p>Amazon, after all, operates satellite networks, runs robotics warehouses, and manages one of the world&#x27;s largest e-commerce platforms. If autonomous agents can learn to write code on their own, the company is betting they can eventually learn to do just about anything else.</p><p>\n</p>",

He knows intimately the late nights consultants spend wrestling with survey data—the kind of quantitative research that forms the backbone of private equity due diligence.</p><p>&quot;Before starting the company, I was working at McKinsey, specifically on the private equity team,&quot; Devbhandari explained in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. The work, he said, involves analyzing encoded survey responses from customers, suppliers, and market participants during potential acquisitions.</p><p>&quot;Consultants typically spend a lot of time doing this in Excel,&quot; he said. &quot;One of the things that surprised me, having worked at a couple of different places, is that the workflow — even at the best firms — really isn&#x27;t that different from some of the boutiques. I always expected there would be some smarter way of doing things, and often there just isn&#x27;t.&quot;</p><p>That gap between expectation and reality became the foundation for <a href=\"https://ascentralabs.ai/\"><u>Ascentra</u></a>. The company&#x27;s platform ingests raw survey data files and outputs formatted Excel workbooks complete with traceable formulas — the kind of deliverable a junior associate would spend hours constructing manually.</p><h2><b>AI has transformed legal work but consulting presents unique technical challenges that have blocked adoption</b></h2><p>The disparity between AI adoption in law versus consulting raises an obvious question: if the consulting market is so large and the workflows so manual, why hasn&#x27;t venture capital flooded the space the way it has legal tech?</p><p>Devbhandari offered a frank assessment. &quot;It&#x27;s not like people haven&#x27;t tried,&quot; he said. &quot;The top of the funnel in our space is crowded. When we speak to our consulting clients, the partners say they get another pitch deck in their LinkedIn inbox or email every week—sometimes several. There are plenty of people trying.&quot;</p><p>The barriers, he argued, are structural. Professional services firms move slowly on technology adoption, demanding extensive security credentials and customer references before granting even a pilot opportunity. &quot;I think that&#x27;s where 90% of startups in professional services, writ large, fall down,&quot; he said.</p><p>But consulting presents unique technical challenges beyond the sales cycle. Unlike legal work, which largely involves text documents that modern large language models handle well, consulting spans multiple data modalities — PowerPoint presentations, Excel spreadsheets, Word documents — with information that can be tabular, graphical, or textual.</p><p>&quot;You can have multiple formats of Excel in itself,&quot; Devbhandari noted. &quot;And that&#x27;s a big contrast to the legal space, where you could have a multi-purpose AI agent, or collection of agents, which can actually do a lot of the tasks that lawyers do day to day. Consulting is the opposite of that.&quot;</p><h2><b>Ascentra&#x27;s private equity focus reflects a calculated bet on repeatable workflows</b></h2><p>Ascentra&#x27;s strategy hinges on extreme specificity. Rather than attempting to automate the full spectrum of consulting work, the company focuses exclusively on survey analysis within private equity due diligence — a niche within a niche.</p><p>The logic is both technical and commercial. Private equity work tends to be more standardized than other consulting engagements, with similar analyses recurring across deals. That repeatability makes automation feasible. It also positions Ascentra against a less formidable competitive set: even the largest consulting firms, Devbhandari claimed, lack dedicated internal tools for this particular workflow.</p><p>&quot;Survey analysis automation is so specific that even the biggest and best firms haven&#x27;t developed anything in-house for it,&quot; he said.</p><p>The company claims that three of the world&#x27;s top five consulting firms now use its platform, with early adopters reporting time savings of 60 to 80 percent on active due diligence projects. But there&#x27;s a notable caveat: Ascentra cannot publicly name any of these clients.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s a very private industry, so at the moment, we can&#x27;t announce any clients publicly,&quot; Devbhandari acknowledged. &quot;What I can say is that we&#x27;re working with three of the top five consulting firms. We&#x27;ve passed pilots at multiple organizations and have submitted business cases for enterprise rollouts.&quot;</p><h2><b>Eliminating AI hallucinations becomes critical when billion-dollar deals hang in the balance</b></h2><p>For an AI company selling into quantitative workflows, accuracy is existential. Consultants delivering analysis to private equity clients face enormous pressure to be precise—a single error in a financial model can undermine credibility and, potentially, billion-dollar investment decisions.</p><p>Devbhandari described this as Ascentra&#x27;s central design challenge. &quot;Consultants require a very, very high degree of fidelity when they&#x27;re doing their analysis,&quot; he said. &quot;So with quantitative data, even if it&#x27;s 95% accurate, they will revert to Excel because they know it, they trust it, and they don&#x27;t want there to be any margin for error.&quot;</p><p>Ascentra&#x27;s technical approach attempts to address this by limiting where AI models operate within the workflow. The company uses GPT-based models from OpenAI to interpret and ingest incoming data, but the actual analysis relies on deterministic Python scripts that produce consistent, verifiable outputs.</p><p>&quot;What&#x27;s different is the steps that follow are deterministic,&quot; Devbhandari explained. &quot;There&#x27;s no room for error. There&#x27;s no hallucinations, and the Excel writer that we&#x27;ve connected to the product on the back end converts this analysis into Excel formula, which are live and traceable, so consultants can get that assurance that they can follow along with the maths.&quot;</p><p>Whether this hybrid approach delivers on its promise of eliminating hallucinations while maintaining useful AI capabilities will be tested as the platform scales across more complex use cases and client environments.</p><h2><b>Enterprise security certifications give Ascentra an edge over less prepared competitors</b></h2><p>Selling software to major consulting firms requires clearing an unusually high security bar. These organizations handle sensitive client data across industries, and their vendor security assessments can take months to complete.</p><p>Ascentra invested early in obtaining enterprise-grade certifications, a strategic choice that Devbhandari framed as essential table stakes. The company has achieved <a href=\"https://secureframe.com/blog/soc-2-type-ii\"><u>SOC 2 Type II</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/27001\"><u>ISO 27001</u></a> certifications and claims to be under audit for <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/42001\"><u>ISO 42001</u></a>, an emerging standard for AI management systems.</p><p>Data handling policies also reflect the sensitivity of the target market. Client data is deleted within 30 to 45 days, depending on contractual terms, and Ascentra does not use customer data to train its models.</p><p>There&#x27;s also an argument that survey data carries somewhat lower sensitivity than other consulting materials. &quot;Survey data is unique in consulting data because it&#x27;s collected during the course of a project, and it is market data,&quot; Devbhandari noted. &quot;You interview people in the market, and you collect a bunch of data in an Excel, as opposed to—you look at Rogo or some of the other finance AI startups—they use client data, so financials, which is confidential and strictly non-public.&quot;</p><h2><b>Per-project pricing aligns with how consulting firms actually spend money</b></h2><p>Ascentra&#x27;s pricing model departs from the subscription-based approach that dominates enterprise software. The company charges on a per-project basis, a structure Devbhandari said aligns with how consulting firms allocate budgets.</p><p>&quot;Project budgets are in consulting set on a per project basis,&quot; he explained. &quot;You&#x27;ll have central budgets which are for things like Microsoft, right, very central things that every team will use all of the time. And then you have project budgets which are for the teams that are using specific resources, teams or products nowadays.&quot;</p><p>This approach may ease initial adoption by avoiding the need for central IT procurement approval, but it also introduces revenue unpredictability. The company&#x27;s success will depend on converting project-level usage into broader enterprise relationships—a path Devbhandari suggested is already underway through submitted business cases for enterprise rollouts.</p><h2><b>AI may not eliminate consulting jobs, but it will fundamentally transform what consultants do</b></h2><p>Perhaps the most interesting tension in Devbhandari&#x27;s vision concerns what AI ultimately means for consulting employment. He pushed back on predictions that AI will eliminate consulting jobs while simultaneously describing an industry on the cusp of fundamental transformation.</p><p>&quot;People love to talk about how AI is going to remove the need for consultants, and I disagree,&quot; he said. &quot;Yes, the role will change, but I don&#x27;t think the industry goes away. I think the best solutions will come from people within the industry building products around the work they know.&quot;</p><p>Yet he also painted a picture of dramatic change. &quot;At the moment, you have a big intake of graduates who just do—for the most part, you know, they have the strategic work as part of what they do, but they also have a lot of work in Excel and PowerPoint. I think in a few years&#x27; time, we&#x27;ll look back at these times and think, you know, very, very different.&quot;</p><p>The honest answer, he acknowledged, is that no one truly knows how this plays out. &quot;I don&#x27;t think even AI leaders truly know what that looks like yet,&quot; he said of whether productivity gains will translate to more work or fewer workers.</p><h2><b>Ascentra plans to use seed funding to expand its U.S. presence and go-to-market team</b></h2><p>The $2 million will primarily fund Ascentra&#x27;s expansion into the United States, where more than 80 percent of its customers are already based. Devbhandari plans to relocate there personally as the company builds out go-to-market capabilities.</p><p>&quot;One of the things that we&#x27;ve really noticed is that with consulting being an American industry, and I think America being a great place for innovation and trying new things, we&#x27;ve definitely drawn ourselves to the U.S.,&quot; he said. &quot;American hires are very expensive, and I&#x27;m sure that a lot of the raise will go towards that.&quot;</p><p>The seed round represents a bet by NAP on what its co-founder Stefan Walter called an overdue disruption. &quot;While most knowledge work has been reshaped by new technology, consulting has remained stubbornly manual,&quot; Walter said. &quot;AI won&#x27;t replace consultants, but consultants using Ascentra might.&quot;</p><h2><b>The startup now faces the hard work of converting pilot wins into lasting enterprise contracts</b></h2><p>Ascentra enters 2026 with momentum but no guarantee of success. The company must transform pilot programs at elite firms into sticky enterprise contracts — all while fending off the inevitable well-funded competitors who will flood into the space once the opportunity becomes undeniable. Its deliberately narrow focus on survey analysis provides a defensible beachhead, but expanding into adjacent workflows will require building entirely new products without sacrificing the domain expertise that Devbhandari argues is the company&#x27;s core advantage.</p><p>Oliver Thurston, Ascentra&#x27;s co-founder and chief technology officer, who previously led machine learning at Mathison AI, offered a clear-eyed assessment of the challenge. &quot;Consulting workflows are uniquely complex and difficult to build products around,&quot; he said in a statement. &quot;It&#x27;s not surprising the space hasn&#x27;t changed yet. This will change though, and there&#x27;s no doubt that the industry is going to look completely different in five years&#x27; time.&quot;</p><p>For now, Ascentra is placing a focused wager: that the consultants who once spent their nights formatting spreadsheets will be the ones who finally bring AI into an industry that has long resisted it. The irony is hard to miss. After years of advising Fortune 500 companies on digital transformation, consulting may finally have to take its own medicine.</p><p>\n</p>",

      "author": "bendee983@gmail.com (Ben Dickson)",
      "summary": "<p>Researchers at MiroMind AI and several Chinese universities have released <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16334\"><u>OpenMMReasoner</u></a>, a new training framework that improves the capabilities of language models in multimodal reasoning.</p><p>The framework uses a two-stage process. It first refines a base model with a curated dataset in a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage. Then, a reinforcement learning (RL) stage guides the model to reason more effectively in tasks that involve both text and visual data. </p><p>Experiments show that models trained with OpenMMReasoner outperform other leading visual reasoning models, often while being trained on a smaller, higher-quality dataset. The framework and all its assets, including a trained 7B model, are fully open source, providing a reliable foundation for building applications that require traceability and robustness.</p><p>According to Kaichen Zhang, co-author of a research paper that outlines the new method, OpenMMReasoner offers significant benefits for businesses looking beyond large, closed systems. &quot;A smaller open-source reasoning model has practical advantages: Enterprises can deploy it locally, reduce latency, lower token costs associated with long chains of thought, maintain full control over their data and [it is] fine-tunable to adapt to their specific downstream task,&quot; he told VentureBeat.</p><h2>The challenge of transparent multimodal reasoning</h2><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) have significantly improved the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). RLVR trains LLMs to generate <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/new-ai-architecture-delivers-100x-faster-reasoning-than-llms-with-just-1000-training-examples\"><u>chain-of-thought</u></a> (CoT) tokens (which mimic the reasoning processes humans use) before generating the final answer. This improves the model’s capability to solve complex reasoning tasks such as math and coding. </p><p>Motivated by this success, researchers have applied similar RL-based methods to <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/baidu-just-dropped-an-open-source-multimodal-ai-that-it-claims-beats-gpt-5\"><u>large multimodal models</u></a> (LMMs), showing that the benefits can extend beyond text to improve visual understanding and problem-solving across different modalities.</p><p>However, a lack of transparency in the training pipeline has been a major barrier. Many studies on multimodal reasoning do not provide detailed information about their data curation and training processes, making it difficult to reproduce their results or understand what makes these models work.</p><p>“This lack of openness restricts reproducibility and obscures a deeper understanding of how reasoning-capable LMMs are actually built and how their training dynamics evolve,” the researchers note.</p><h2>The OpenMMReasoner recipe</h2><p>OpenMMReasoner addresses this gap with a fully transparent and scalable training recipe built on open-source LMMs. The researchers found it was critical to curate high-quality datasets by scaling data diversity. Although using diverse data sources is important, increasing the diversity of correct answers for the same question was an essential axis for improvement.</p><p>The first stage of the recipe is a three-step supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. It begins with data sourcing, where the team collected approximately 103,000 raw question-answer pairs from public datasets covering general visual Q&amp;A and reasoning tasks. Next, they added a data <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/meta-researchers-distill-system-2-thinking-into-llms-improving-performance-on-complex-reasoning\"><u>distillation step</u></a>, using a powerful model (<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibabas-new-open-source-qwen3-235b-a22b-2507-beats-kimi-2-and-offers-low-compute-version\"><u>Qwen3-VL-235B-Instruct</u></a>) to generate new, high-quality reasoning traces for selected questions. (The data will then be used to train a smaller model.)</p><p>To increase answer diversity, the team generated multiple verified reasoning traces for each question. This expanded the dataset to 583,000 samples. Finally, they implemented a “domain mixing” phase, adding data from mathematical reasoning domains to further generalize the model&#x27;s capabilities, resulting in a final SFT dataset of 874,000 examples.</p><p>The second stage is an RL recipe that uses a smaller, 74,000-sample dataset curated from domains like science, math and puzzles. The model is trained with a composite reward function that considers both the correctness of the final answer and the consistency of the output format. To improve efficiency, the process includes a penalty for &quot;overthinking,&quot; discouraging the model from generating excessively long answers (a problem with many reasoning models trained through RL, which mistakenly learn to generate overly long reasoning sequences, resulting in excess cost and slower answers).</p><p>This recipe can provide a blueprint for enterprises training their own models. &quot;For companies with limited domain-specific data, a feasible strategy is to first increase answer diversity for their existing dataset, then use domain mixing to integrate this domain data into a general reasoning recipe like ours,&quot; Zhang explained. &quot;This allows the model to acquire strong general-purpose reasoning skills while also adapting to industry-specific tasks, without needing millions of samples.&quot;</p><h2>A more efficient and capable reasoning model</h2><p>According to Zhang, the step-by-step process fundamentally changes the reliability of the model&#x27;s outputs. &quot;Traditional models often &#x27;jump&#x27; directly to an answer, which means they explore only a narrow portion of the reasoning space,&quot; he said. &quot;In contrast, a reasoning-first approach forces the model to explicitly examine multiple intermediate steps... [allowing it] to traverse much deeper paths and arrive at answers with far more internal consistency.&quot;</p><p>The researchers used the OpenMMReasoner recipe to generate data to fine-tune the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct open-source vision-language model. The result is a highly capable LMM that consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, such as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05255\"><u>Open Vision Reasoner</u></a> (OVR), across a wide range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks. The SFT stage alone creates a strong baseline model that achieves superior performance and data efficiency compared to other SFT approaches, despite using a significantly smaller training dataset.</p><p>The subsequent RL phase further sharpens and stabilizes these abilities, leading to more consistent and improved performance. After RL, the final model achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks, including WeMath, MathVerse and MathVista.</p><p>One of the key findings was that, as the model improved at multimodal reasoning, it also showed a &quot;gradual emergence of textual reasoning behaviors, suggesting a transfer of reasoning competence from multimodal to purely linguistic domains,&quot; the researchers note. This indicates that skills learned in one modality can strengthen performance in another. </p><p>&quot;Our results show that strengthening multimodal reasoning can even improve text-only mathematical skills—evidence that core logical abilities can transfer across modalities,&quot; Zhang said. &quot;Looking ahead, we do expect these methods to extend to video and audio.&quot;</p><p>The researchers also found that token efficiency is crucial. While allowing a model to generate longer reasoning steps can improve performance, excessive tokens reduce efficiency. Their results show that setting a smaller &quot;reasoning budget&quot; can achieve comparable or even better accuracy, an important consideration for deploying cost-effective enterprise applications.</p><p>By <a href=\"https://evolvinglmms-lab.github.io/OpenMMReasoner/\"><u>open-sourcing all components</u></a> of their workflow, the researchers provide a reproducible view of the entire process. For enterprise teams, this transparency is invaluable. &quot;For business leaders concerned about vendor lock-in, hidden biases or opaque data sources, this level of transparency is essential,&quot; Zhang stated. &quot;It empowers teams to validate the data, customize the pipeline for new domains and maintain long-term independence from any single provider.&quot;</p>",

      "summary": "<p><a href=\"https://mistral.ai/\">Mistral AI</a>, Europe&#x27;s most prominent artificial intelligence startup, is releasing its most ambitious product suite to date: a family of 10 open-source models designed to run everywhere from smartphones and autonomous drones to enterprise cloud systems, marking a major escalation in the company&#x27;s challenge to both U.S. tech giants and surging Chinese competitors.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-3\">Mistral 3 family</a>, launching today, includes a new flagship model called <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-3\">Mistral Large 3</a> and a suite of smaller &quot;<a href=\"https://mistral.ai/models\">Ministral 3</a>&quot; models optimized for edge computing applications. All models will be released under the permissive Apache 2.0 license, allowing unrestricted commercial use — a sharp contrast to the closed systems offered by <a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/\">Google</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/\">Anthropic</a>.</p><p>The release is a pointed bet by Mistral that the future of artificial intelligence lies not in building ever-larger proprietary systems, but in offering businesses maximum flexibility to customize and deploy AI tailored to their specific needs, often using smaller models that can run without cloud connectivity.</p><p>&quot;The gap between closed and open source is getting smaller, because more and more people are contributing to open source, which is great,&quot; Guillaume Lample, Mistral&#x27;s chief scientist and co-founder, said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &quot;We are catching up fast.&quot;</p><h2><b>Why Mistral is choosing flexibility over frontier performance in the AI race</b></h2><p>The strategic calculus behind <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-3\">Mistral 3</a> diverges sharply from recent model releases by industry leaders. While <a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/\">Google</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/\">Anthropic</a> have focused recent launches on increasingly capable &quot;agentic&quot; systems — AI that can autonomously execute complex multi-step tasks — Mistral is prioritizing breadth, efficiency, and what Lample calls &quot;distributed intelligence.&quot;</p><p>Mistral <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/models\">Large 3</a>, the flagship model, employs a <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/blog/moe\">Mixture of Experts</a> architecture with 41 billion active parameters drawn from a total pool of 675 billion parameters. The model can process both text and images, handles context windows up to 256,000 tokens, and was trained with particular emphasis on non-English languages — a rarity among frontier AI systems.</p><p>&quot;Most AI labs focus on their native language, but Mistral Large 3 was trained on a wide variety of languages, making advanced AI useful for billions who speak different native languages,&quot; the company said in a statement reviewed ahead of the announcement.</p><p>But the more significant departure lies in the <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/models\">Ministral 3</a> lineup: nine compact models across three sizes (14 billion, 8 billion, and 3 billion parameters) and three variants tailored for different use cases. Each variant serves a distinct purpose: base models for extensive customization, instruction-tuned models for general chat and task completion, and reasoning-optimized models for complex logic requiring step-by-step deliberation.</p><p>The smallest Ministral 3 models can run on devices with as little as 4 gigabytes of video memory using 4-bit quantization — making frontier AI capabilities accessible on standard laptops, smartphones, and embedded systems without requiring expensive cloud infrastructure or even internet connectivity. This approach reflects Mistral&#x27;s belief that AI&#x27;s next evolution will be defined not by sheer scale, but by ubiquity: models small enough to run on drones, in vehicles, in robots, and on consumer devices.</p><h2><b>How fine-tuned small models beat expensive large models for enterprise customers</b></h2><p>Lample&#x27;s comments reveal a business model fundamentally different from that of closed-source competitors. Rather than competing primarily on benchmark performance, Mistral is targeting enterprise customers frustrated by the cost and inflexibility of proprietary systems.</p><p>&quot;Sometimes customers say, &#x27;Is there a use case where the best closed-source model isn&#x27;t working?&#x27; If that&#x27;s the case, then they&#x27;re essentially stuck,&quot; Lample explained. &quot;There&#x27;s nothing they can do. It&#x27;s the best model available, and it&#x27;s not working out of the box.&quot;</p><p>This is where Mistral&#x27;s approach diverges. When a generic model fails, the company deploys engineering teams to work directly with customers, analyzing specific problems, creating synthetic training data, and fine-tuning smaller models to outperform larger general-purpose systems on narrow tasks.</p><p>&quot;In more than 90% of cases, a small model can do the job, especially if it&#x27;s fine-tuned. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a model with hundreds of billions of parameters, just a 14-billion or 24-billion parameter model,&quot; Lample said. &quot;So it&#x27;s not only much cheaper, but also faster, plus you have all the benefits: you don&#x27;t need to worry about privacy, latency, reliability, and so on.&quot;</p><p>The economic argument is compelling. Multiple enterprise customers have approached Mistral after building prototypes with expensive closed-source models, only to find deployment costs prohibitive at scale, according to Lample.</p><p>&quot;They come back to us a couple of months later because they realize, &#x27;We built this prototype, but it&#x27;s way too slow and way too expensive,&#x27;&quot; he said.</p><h2><b>Where Mistral 3 fits in the increasingly crowded open-source AI market</b></h2><p>Mistral&#x27;s release comes amid fierce competition on multiple fronts. OpenAI recently released <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-1-codex-max/\">GPT-5.1</a> with enhanced agentic capabilities. Google launched <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/\">Gemini 3</a> with improved multimodal understanding. Anthropic released <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5\">Opus 4.5</a> on the same day as this interview, with similar agent-focused features.</p><p>But Lample argues those comparisons miss the point. &quot;It&#x27;s a little bit behind. But I think what matters is that we are catching up fast,&quot; he acknowledged regarding performance against closed models. &quot;I think we are maybe playing a strategic long game.&quot;</p><p>That long game involves a different competitive set: primarily open-source models from Chinese companies like <a href=\"https://www.deepseek.com/\">DeepSeek</a> and Alibaba&#x27;s <a href=\"https://qwen.ai/home\">Qwen</a> series, which have made remarkable strides in recent months.</p><p>Mistral differentiates itself through multilingual capabilities that extend far beyond English or Chinese, multimodal integration handling both text and images in a unified model, and what the company characterizes as superior customization through easier fine-tuning.</p><p>&quot;One key difference with the models themselves is that we focused much more on multilinguality,&quot; Lample said. &quot;If you look at all the top models from [Chinese competitors], they&#x27;re all text-only. They have visual models as well, but as separate systems. We wanted to integrate everything into a single model.&quot;</p><p>The multilingual emphasis aligns with Mistral&#x27;s broader positioning as a European AI champion focused on digital sovereignty — the principle that organizations and nations should maintain control over their AI infrastructure and data.</p><h2><b>Building beyond models: Mistral&#x27;s full-stack enterprise AI platform strategy</b></h2><p>Mistral 3&#x27;s release builds on an increasingly comprehensive enterprise AI platform that extends well beyond model development. The company has assembled a full-stack offering that differentiates it from pure model providers.</p><p>Recent product launches include <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/agents-api\">Mistral Agents API</a>, which combines language models with built-in connectors for code execution, web search, image generation, and persistent memory across conversations; <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/magistral\">Magistral</a>, the company&#x27;s reasoning model designed for domain-specific, transparent, and multilingual reasoning; and <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-code\">Mistral Code</a>, an AI-powered coding assistant bundling models, an in-IDE assistant, and local deployment options with enterprise tooling.</p><p>The consumer-facing <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/products/le-chat\">Le Chat assistant</a> has been enhanced with Deep Research mode for structured research reports, voice capabilities, and Projects for organizing conversations into context-rich folders. More recently, Le Chat gained a connector directory with 20+ enterprise integrations powered by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), spanning tools like Databricks, Snowflake, GitHub, Atlassian, Asana, and Stripe.</p><p>In October, Mistral unveiled <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/products/ai-studio\">AI Studio</a>, a production AI platform providing observability, agent runtime, and AI registry capabilities to help enterprises track output changes, monitor usage, run evaluations, and fine-tune models using proprietary data.</p><p>Mistral now positions itself as a full-stack, global enterprise AI company, offering not just models but an application-building layer through AI Studio, compute infrastructure, and forward-deployed engineers to help businesses realize return on investment.</p><h2><b>Why open source AI matters for customization, transparency and sovereignty</b></h2><p>Mistral&#x27;s commitment to open-source development under permissive licenses is both an ideological stance and a competitive strategy in an AI landscape increasingly dominated by closed systems.</p><p>Lample elaborated on the practical benefits: &quot;I think something that people don&#x27;t realize — but our customers know this very well — is how much better any model can actually improve if you fine tune it on the task of interest. There&#x27;s a huge gap between a base model and one that&#x27;s fine-tuned for a specific task, and in many cases, it outperforms the closed-source model.&quot;</p><p>The approach enables capabilities impossible with closed systems: organizations can fine-tune models on proprietary data that never leaves their infrastructure, customize architectures for specific workflows, and maintain complete transparency into how AI systems make decisions — critical for regulated industries like finance, healthcare, and defense.</p><p>This positioning has attracted government and public sector partnerships. The company launched &quot;<a href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/ai-for-citizens\">AI for Citizens</a>&quot; in July 2025, an initiative to &quot;help States and public institutions strategically harness AI for their people by transforming public services&quot; and has secured strategic partnerships with France&#x27;s army and job agency, Luxembourg&#x27;s government, and various European public sector organizations.</p><h2><b>Mistral&#x27;s transatlantic AI collaboration goes beyond European borders</b></h2><p>While Mistral is frequently characterized as Europe&#x27;s answer to OpenAI, the company views itself as a transatlantic collaboration rather than a purely European venture. The company has teams across both continents, with co-founders spending significant time with customers and partners in the United States, and these models are being trained in partnerships with U.S.-based teams and infrastructure providers.</p><p>This transatlantic positioning may prove strategically important as geopolitical tensions around AI development intensify. The recent ASML investment, a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/09/business/asml-mistral-ai-chips-investment.html\">€1.7 billion ($1.5 billion) funding round</a> led by the Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer, signals deepening collaboration across the Western semiconductor and AI value chain at a moment when both Europe and the United States are seeking to reduce dependence on Chinese technology.</p><p>Mistral&#x27;s investor base reflects this dynamic: the Series C round included participation from U.S. firms <a href=\"https://a16z.com/\">Andreessen Horowitz</a>, <a href=\"https://www.generalcatalyst.com/\">General Catalyst</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedhq.com/\">Lightspeed</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.indexventures.com/\">Index Ventures</a> alongside European investors like France&#x27;s state-backed Bpifrance and global players like DST Global and Nvidia.</p><p>Founded in May 2023 by former Google DeepMind and Meta researchers, Mistral has raised roughly $1.05 billion (€1 billion) in funding. The company was valued at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/11/paris-based-ai-startup-mistral-ai-raises-640-million/\">$6 billion</a> in a June 2024 Series B, then <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-ai-raises-1-7-b-to-accelerate-technological-progress-with-ai\">more than doubled its valuation</a> in a September Series C.</p><h2><b>Can customization and efficiency beat raw performance in enterprise AI?</b></h2><p>The <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-3\">Mistral 3 </a>release crystallizes a fundamental question facing the AI industry: Will enterprises ultimately prioritize the absolute cutting-edge capabilities of proprietary systems, or will they choose open, customizable alternatives that offer greater control, lower costs, and independence from big tech platforms?</p><p>Mistral&#x27;s answer is unambiguous. The company is betting that as AI moves from prototype to production, the factors that matter most shift dramatically. Raw benchmark scores matter less than total cost of ownership. Slight performance edges matter less than the ability to fine-tune for specific workflows. Cloud-based convenience matters less than data sovereignty and edge deployment.</p><p>It&#x27;s a wager with significant risks. Despite Lample&#x27;s optimism about closing the performance gap, Mistral&#x27;s models still trail the absolute frontier. The company&#x27;s revenue, while growing, reportedly remains modest relative to its nearly $14 billion valuation. And competition intensifies from both well-funded Chinese rivals making remarkable open-source progress and U.S. tech giants increasingly offering their own smaller, more efficient models.</p><p>But if Mistral is right — if the future of AI looks less like a handful of cloud-based oracles and more like millions of specialized systems running everywhere from factory floors to smartphones — then the company has positioned itself at the center of that transformation.</p><p>The release of <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-3\">Mistral 3 </a>is the most comprehensive expression yet of that vision: 10 models, spanning every size category, optimized for every deployment scenario, available to anyone who wants to build with them.</p><p>Whether &quot;distributed intelligence&quot; becomes the industry&#x27;s dominant paradigm or remains a compelling alternative serving a narrower market will determine not just Mistral&#x27;s fate, but the broader question of who controls the AI future — and whether that future will be open.</p><p>For now, the race is on. And Mistral is betting it can win not by building the biggest model, but by building everywhere else.</p>",

      "summary": "<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\"><u>AWS</u></a> is leveraging <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/for-regulated-industries-awss-neurosymbolic-ai-promises-safe-explainable-agent-automation\"><u>automated reasoning</u></a>, which uses math-based verification, to build out new capabilities in its Amazon <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/aws-unveils-bedrock-agentcore-a-new-platform-for-building-enterprise-ai-agents-with-open-source-frameworks-and-tools?ref=runtime.news\"><u>Bedrock AgentCore</u></a> platform as the company digs deeper into the agentic AI ecosystem. </p><p>Announced during its annual re: Invent conference in Las Vegas, AWS is adding three new capabilities to AgentCore: &quot;policy,&quot; &quot;evaluations&quot; and &quot;episodic memory.&quot; The new features aim to give enterprises more control over agent behavior and performance. </p><p>AWS also revealed what it calls “a new class of agents,&quot; or &quot;frontier agents,&quot; that are autonomous, scalable and independent. </p><p>Swami Sivasubramanian, AWS VP for Agentic AI, told VentureBeat that many of AWS’s new features represent a shift in who becomes a builder. </p><p>“We are actually on the cusp of a major tectonic transformation with AI, but agentic AI is truly starting to transform what is the art of the possible, and it is going to make this one of the most truly transforming technologies,” Sivasubramanian said. </p><h2>Policy agents</h2><p>The new p<!-- -->olicy capability helps enterprises reinforce guidelines even after the agent has already reasoned its response. </p><p>AWS VP for AgentCore David Richardson told VentureBeat that the policy tool sits between the agent and the tools it calls, rather than being baked into the agent, as fine-tuning often is. The idea is to prevent an agent from violating enterprise rules and redirect it to re-evaluate its reasoning. </p><p>Richardson gave the example of a customer service agent: A company would write a policy stating that the agent can grant a refund of up to $100, but for anything higher, the agent would need to bounce the customer to a human. He noted that it remains easy to subvert an agent&#x27;s reasoning loop through, for instance, prompt injection or poisoned data, leading agents to ignore guardrails. </p><p>“There are always these prompt injection attacks where people try to subvert the reasoning of the agent to get the agent to do things it shouldn’t do,” Richardson said. “That’s why we implemented the policy outside of the agent, and it works using the automated reasoning capabilities that we’ve spent years building up to help customer define their capabilities.”</p><p>AWS unveiled <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/aws-bedrock-upgrades-to-add-model-teaching-hallucination-detector\"><u>Automated Reasoning Checks</u></a> on Bedrock at last year’s re: Invent. These use neurosymbolic AI, or math-based validation, to prove correctness. The tool applies mathematical proofs to models to confirm that it hasn’t hallucinated. AWS has been leaning heavily into neurosymbolic AI and automated reasoning, pushing for enterprise-grade security and safety in ways that differ from other AI model providers.</p><h2>Episodic memories and evaluations</h2><p>The two other new updates to AgentCore, &quot;evaluations&quot; and &quot;episodic memory,&quot; also give enterprises a better view of agent performance and give agents episodic memory.</p><p>A<!-- -->n enhancement of AgentCore memory, episodic memory refers to knowledge that agents tap into only occasionally, unlike longer-running preferences, which they have to refer back to constantly. Context window limits hamper some agents, so they sometimes forget information or conversations they haven’t tapped into for a while. </p><p>“The idea is to help capture information that a user really would wish the agent remembered when they came back,&quot; said Richardson. &quot;For example, &#x27;what is their preferred seat on an airplane for family trips?&#x27; Or &#x27;what is the sort of price range they&#x27;re looking for?&#x27;&quot;</p><p>Episodic memory differs from the previously shipped AgentCore memory because, instead of relying on maintaining short- and long-term memory, agents built on AgentCore can recall certain information based on triggers. This can eliminate the need for custom instructions.</p><p>With AgentCore evaluations, organizations can use 13 pre-built evaluators or write their own. Developers can set alerts to warn them if agents begin to fail quality monitoring.</p><h2>Frontier agents</h2><p>But perhaps AWS&#x27;s strongest push into enterprise agentic AI is the release of frontier agents, or fully automated and independent agents that the company says can act as teammates with little direction. </p><p>The concept is similar, if not identical, to those of more asynchronous agents from competitors like <a href=\"https://www.google.com/\"><u>Google</u></a> and<a href=\"https://openai.com/\"><u> OpenAI</u></a>. However, AWS seems to be releasing more than just autonomous coding agents. </p><p>Sivasubramanian called them a &quot;new class&quot; of agents, &quot;not only a step function change in what you can do today; they move from assisting with individual tasks to complex projects.&quot;</p><p>The first is Kiro, an autonomous coding agent that has been in <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/programming-development/amazon-launches-kiro-its-own-claude-powered-challenger-to-windsurf-and-codex\">public preview since July</a>. At the time, Kiro was billed as an alternative to vibe coding platforms like OpenAI’s <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-debuts-gpt-5-1-codex-max-coding-model-and-it-already-completed-a-24\"><u>Codex</u></a> or <a href=\"https://windsurf.com/\"><u>Windsurf</u></a>. Similar to Codex and Google’s myriad asynchronous coding agents, <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/googles-jules-coding-agent-moves-beyond-chat-with-new-command-line-and-api\"><u>including Jules</u></a>, Kiro can code, undertake reviews, fix bugs independently and determine the tasks it needs to accomplish. </p><p>AWS security agent, meanwhile, embeds deep security expertise into applications from the start. The company said in a press release that users “define security standards once and AWS security agent automatically validates them across your applications during its review — helping teams address the risks that matter to their business, not generic checklists.”</p><p>The AWS DevOps agent will help developers, especially those on call, proactively find system breaks or bugs. It can respond to incidents using its knowledge of the application or service. It also acknowledges the relationships between the application and the tools it taps, such as Amazon CloudWatch, Datadog and Splunk, to trace the root cause of the issue. </p><p>Enterprises are interested in deploying agents and, eventually, bringing more autonomous agents into their workflows. And, while companies like AWS continue to bolster these agents with security and control, organizations are slowly figuring out how to connect them all. </p>",

      "link": "https://venturebeat.com/ai/headless-vs-native-semantic-layer-the-architectural-key-to-unlocking-90-text",
      "published_date": "2025-12-02T05:00:00",
      "author": "N/A",
      "summary": "<p>Every data engineering team right now is being asked the same question: <i>&quot;How do we build a chatbot that talks to our data?&quot;</i></p><p>The prototypes are deceptively simple. A developer connects <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-1/\"><u>GPT-5.1</u></a> to a <a href=\"https://www.snowflake.com/en/\"><u>Snowflake</u></a> schema, asks &quot;What is our revenue?&quot;, and watches as the model generates a syntactically perfect SQL query. It feels like magic. But when these systems move from a sandbox to production, the magic collapses. The bot reports $12 million revenue on Monday and $9.5 million on Tuesday, despite the underlying data remaining unchanged.</p><p>The failure isn&#x27;t a lack of model intelligence; it is an architectural &quot;context gap.&quot; Gen AI models are probabilistic engines trying to interpret rigid, deterministic business logic from raw database schemas. Without a mediation layer to define what &quot;revenue&quot; actually means, the model guesses.</p><h3><b>Why direct Text-to-SQL agents fail?</b></h3><p>To understand why a semantic layer is non-negotiable for gen AI, one must dissect the anatomy of a text-to-SQL failure. The issue is rarely invalid syntax; it is semantic ambiguity. When a large language model (LLM) scans a raw database schema, it lacks the &quot;tribal knowledge&quot; inherent to the business, leading to mathematically correct but functionally false results. </p><p>For example, consider a common scenario at a global logistics retailer. Their business intelligence (BI) dashboard shows 98% on-time delivery. However, their new AI agent querying raw shipping tables reports 92%. The difference? The AI failed to exclude &quot;customer-waived delays&quot; — a filter that exists only in the BI tool, not the database. This 6% gap didn&#x27;t just break the bot; it broke trust in the data team.</p><h3><b>The solution: Build a semantic layer</b></h3><p>Recent empirical evidence reveals the scale of this problem. A <a href=\"https://data.world/mstatic/assets/pdf/kg_llm_accuracy_benchmark_11132023_public.pdf\"><u>2024 study</u></a> by semantic data vendor <a href=\"https://data.world/resources/webinar/chat-with-data-benchmark-improving-the-accuracy-of-llm-responses-in-the-enterprise/\"><u>data.world</u></a> found that, when tasked with generating SQL from raw schemas, GPT-4 achieved a success rate of just <b>16.7%</b>. When the same model was grounded with a semantic layer — a &quot;Rosetta Stone&quot; defining business logic — accuracy tripled to <b>54.2%</b>. <a href=\"https://www.hpcwire.com/bigdatawire/2024/08/15/atscale-claims-text-to-sql-breakthrough-with-semantic-layer/\"><u>AtScale</u></a><b>, </b>another semantic layer vendor, reported even higher figures —   <b>92.5%</b> accuracy on the <a href=\"https://www.tpc.org/tpcds/\"><u>TPC-DS</u></a> benchmark—by enforcing valid join paths and pre-defined metrics. </p><p>The Enterprise Semantic Layer has evolved from a tool for dashboards into a critical requirement for AI. It is effectively the &quot;metrics API&quot; that stops AI from guessing your business rules. Currently, vendors are racing to standardize this layer. <a href=\"https://www.snowflake.com/en/\"><u>Snowflake</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/blog/agentic-future-demands-open-semantic-layer/\"><u>Salesforce</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-labs-affirms-commitment-to-open-semantic-interchange-by-open-sourcing-metricflow\"><u>dbt Labs</u></a> and partners launched the <a href=\"https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-salesforce-dbt-labs-and-more-revolutionize-data-readiness-for-ai-with-open-semantic-interchange-initiative/\"><u>Open Semantic Interchange (OSI)</u></a>, a vendor-neutral spec aimed at making metric/semantic definitions portable across tools and clouds. If OSI sticks, portability becomes the real moat.</p><p>In the meantime, the big question for data leaders is where to implement this logic. The market has split into two architectural philosophies: Building it close to the database<b> </b>(embedded natively in Snowflake, Databricks or Microsoft Fabric) for simplicity, or using a platform-agnostic layer (like dbt MetricFlow or Cube) for independence.</p><h3><b>Architecture A: The &quot;headless&quot; strategy</b></h3><p>The &quot;headless&quot; (or platform-agnostic) philosophy is built on a single, uncompromising premise: Decoupling. Instead of locking metric definitions inside a specific dashboard or database, this architecture forces you to define them in a neutral middle layer. The goal is simple — define &quot;revenue&quot; once in code, and serve that exact number to Tableau, Excel and AI Agents simultaneously.</p><p>How it works:<b> </b>Functionally, these systems act as a universal translation engine sitting between your storage and your consumption tools. When an AI agent requests get_metric(churn), the headless layer reads the definition from a YAML configuration, compiles the necessary SQL (automatically handling complex joins, filters and fan-outs) and executes it against your data warehouse.</p><p><b>The key players:</b></p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.getdbt.com\"><b><u>dbt</u></b></a><b>:</b> dbt Labs has positioned <a href=\"https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/about-metricflow\"><u>MetricFlow</u></a> as the industry&#x27;s query transpiler. It generates optimized SQL at runtime and pushes it down to Snowflake or BigQuery. </p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://cube.dev\"><b><u>Cube</u></b></a><b>:</b> Cube ships a semantic layer and also has support for an <a href=\"https://cube.dev/docs/product/apis-integrations/mcp-server\"><u>MCP</u></a> server so agents can call governed metrics as tools instead of guessing SQL. </p></li></ul><p>Interestingly, both dbt Labs and Cube have joined OSI, the vendor-neutral standard launched in 2025 that makes these definitions portable across any tool.</p><h3><b>Architecture B: The &quot;platform-native&quot; strategy</b></h3><p>Platform-native architecture (often called the &quot;walled garden&quot;) flips the script by embedding semantic definitions directly into the storage or compute engine. The philosophy here is integration over independence. By keeping the logic next to the data, these platforms offer superior performance and zero-copy access, removing the need for a separate server.</p><p><b>How it works: </b>Native execution; instead of a separate translation layer, the database engine itself understands metrics. When you define a semantic model here, it compiles into native database objects. This unlocks high-performance access — where the semantic engine reads directly from storage memory, bypassing standard SQL overhead. It also allows the platform’s native AI assistants to &quot;read&quot; the metadata instantly without external connectors.</p><p><b>The key players:</b></p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-fabric\"><b><u>Microsoft Fabric</u></b></a><b> (</b><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-science/semantic-link-overview\"><b><u>Semantic Link</u></b></a><b>):</b> For teams already standardized on Power BI/Fabric, semantic link minimizes integration overhead for notebooks and copilots. Microsoft&#x27;s semantic link (SemPy) feature allows Python notebooks to &quot;mount&quot; Power BI datasets as if they were pandas DataFrames, letting data scientists reuse executive dashboard logic instantly. While historically closed, Microsoft is responding to the agent wave: In November 2025, they released a public preview of a <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/mcp/mcp-servers-overview\"><u>Power BI Modeling MCP Server</u></a>, signaling a move to open up their &quot;walled garden&quot; to external agents.</p></li><li><p><b>Snowflake and Databricks:</b> Both vendors have aggressively closed the gap. Snowflake <b>(</b><a href=\"https://www.snowflake.com/en/product/features/cortex/\"><b><u>Cortex AI</u></b></a><b>)</b> and Databricks  <b>(</b><a href=\"https://www.databricks.com/product/unity-catalog\"><b><u>Unity Catalog</u></b></a><b>)</b> now support governed, YAML-based metric views. Unlike early iterations that relied on AI inference, these are deterministic definitions that power their internal AI chatbots, ensuring a &quot;single source of truth&quot; within their respective lakehouses.</p></li></ul><h3><b>The engineering reality: Why you can&#x27;t just &quot;move&quot;</b></h3><p>A common question from leadership is, <i>&quot;We already have business logic in </i><a href=\"https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/navigation/reporting\"><i><u>Looker</u></i></a><i> or </i><a href=\"https://app.powerbi.com\"><i><u>Power BI</u></i></a><i>. Can&#x27;t we just export it to a headless layer?&quot;</i> The answer is rarely yes. Migrating business logic is not a copy-paste operation; it is a fundamental data modelling exercise. The logic embedded in these tools relies on proprietary &quot;magic&quot; that standard SQL — and by extension, headless semantic layers — does not perform automatically.</p><p>Engineers attempting to &quot;lift and shift&quot; usually hit specific architectural walls. For instance, <a href=\"https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/navigation/reporting\"><u>Looker</u></a> uses a feature called &quot;symmetric aggregates&quot; to automatically prevent revenue from being double-counted when joining multiple tables — a safeguard that vanishes in raw SQL unless you manually re-engineer the join logic. Similarly, <a href=\"https://app.powerbi.com\"><u>Power BI</u></a>’s <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/\"><u>DAX</u></a> language performs dynamic calculations based on the specific &quot;context&quot; of a visual (like a pivot table filter). Recreating this dynamic behavior in static SQL requires writing verbose, complex code to achieve what Power BI does in a single line.</p><p>This migration friction is the technical debt that must be paid to enable the AI era. Organizations that leave their logic locked in proprietary BI formats effectively wall off their &quot;single source of truth&quot; from their AI agents, forcing developers to duplicate logic in Python and reintroducing the risk of hallucination.</p><h3><b>Which architecture wins?</b></h3><p>There is no single &quot;winner&quot; in the battle for the semantic layer. While both approaches solve the accuracy problem, they impose drastically different constraints on your infrastructure. The choice comes down to a trade-off between integration speed and architectural independence. </p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Feature</b></p></td><td><p><b>Headless / necoupled (dbt, Cube)</b></p></td><td><p><b>Platform-Native (Snowflake, Fabric, Databricks)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Philosophy</p></td><td><p>Define once, serve everywhere</p></td><td><p>Unified lakehouse / direct integration</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>AI interface</p></td><td><p>API / tools (REST, GraphQL, MCP)</p></td><td><p>SQL and notebooks (SemPy, Cortex)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Lock-in</p></td><td><p>Lower (code/YAML portability)</p></td><td><p>Higher (platform objects)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Best fit</p></td><td><p>Multi-cloud agents, external apps</p></td><td><p>Internal copilots, single ecosystem</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>The Verdict: Which architecture should you choose? </h3><p>If you are 90%-plus standardized on a single platform (Power BI/Fabric or Snowflake): </p><ul><li><p>Default to platform-native for internal copilots and employee-facing agents</p></li><li><p>Accept the lock-in trade-off in exchange for zero-integration overhead</p></li><li><p>Design escape hatch: Keep one &quot;golden metric set&quot; in portable YAML alongside native definitions</p></li></ul><p>If you are building customer-facing agents or multi-cloud/multi-source systems</p><ul><li><p>Start with headless architecture (dbt MetricFlow or Cube)</p></li><li><p>Treat semantic layer as your &quot;metrics API&quot; — agents call get_metric(), not raw SQL</p></li><li><p>Budget for caching layer (Cube Store or similar) to prevent agent query storms</p></li></ul><p>If your metrics are trapped in Looker/Power BI/Tableau:</p><ul><li><p>Accept this as technical debt that must be paid before agents can safely use your data</p></li><li><p>Start with 10–20 &quot;tier-0&quot; metrics (revenue, churn, CAC) and manually re-engineer their logic in SQL/YAML</p></li><li><p>Do NOT try to auto-migrate — symmetric aggregates and DAX context require explicit redesign</p></li></ul><p>The launch of OSI signals a future where this trade-off may diminish. If the industry converges on a truly portable standard, metric definitions could theoretically move from <a href=\"https://www.snowflake.com/en/\"><u>Snowflake</u></a> to <a href=\"https://www.getdbt.com\"><u>dbt</u></a> to <a href=\"https://www.tableau.com\"><u>Tableau</u></a> without friction. But until that standard matures, the Headless layer offers the most explicit &#x27;API-first&#x27; contract for agents that span multiple systems or serve external users, though platform-native layers are rapidly closing this gap with their own agent-oriented tooling.</p><p>The era of the &quot;dashboard&quot; is yielding to the era of the &quot;agent.&quot; To survive the transition, your data stack needs more than just a faster database; it needs explicit, governed business logic that LLMs can consume without guessing.</p>",
