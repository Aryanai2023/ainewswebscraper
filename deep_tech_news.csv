"For This Engineer, Taking Deep Dives Is Part of the Job",https://spectrum.ieee.org/levi-unema-underwater-robotics-exploration,2025-11-27T13:00:02,Edd Gent,"<img src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-person-stands-on-a-boat-in-front-of-a-large-mechanical-apparatus-bearing-noaa-logo.png?id=62218869&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C409%2C0%2C409"" /><br /><br /><p>Early in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-unema-a5614381/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Levi Unema</a>’s career as an electrical engineer, he was presented with an unusual opportunity. While working on assembly lines at an automotive parts supplier in 2015, he got a surprise call from his high-school science teacher that set him off on an entirely new path: piloting underwater robots to explore <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/underwater-robotics"" target=""_self"">the ocean’s deepest abysses</a>.</p><p>That call came from <a href=""https://nthf.org/inductees/harlan-kredit/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Harlan Kredit</a>, a nationally renowned science teacher and board member of a Rhode Island-based nonprofit called the <a href=""https://www.engineeringfordiscovery.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Global Foundation for Ocean Exploration</a> (GFOE). The organization was looking for an electrical engineer to help design, build, and pilot remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) for the U.S. <a href=""https://www.noaa.gov/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>.</p><h3>Levi Unema</h3><br /><p><strong></strong><strong>Employer</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Deep Exploration Solutions</p><p><strong>Occupation</strong></p><p><strong></strong>ROV engineer</p><p><strong>Education  </strong></p><p>Bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering, Michigan Technological University</p><p>This was an exciting break for Unema, a Washington state native who had grown up tinkering with electronics and exploring the outdoors. Unema joined the team in early 2016 and has since helped develop and operate deep-sea robots for scientific expeditions around the globe.</p><p>The GFOE’s contract with NOAA expired in July, forcing the engineering team to disband. But soon after, Unema teamed up with four former colleagues to start their own ROV consultancy, called <a href=""https://deepexplorationsolutions.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Deep Exploration Solutions</a>, to continue the work he’s so passionate about.</p><p>“I love the exploration and just seeing new things every day,” he says. “And the engineering challenges that go along with it are really exciting, because there’s a lot of pressure down there and a lot of technical problems to solve.”</p><h2>Nature and Technology</h2><p>Unema’s fascination with electronics started early. Growing up in Lynden, Wash., he took apart radios, modified headphones, and hacked together USB chargers from AA batteries. “I’ve always had to know how things work,” he says. He was also a Boy Scout, and much of his youth was spent hiking, camping, and snowboarding.</p><p>That love of both technology and nature can be traced back, at least in part, to his parents—his father was a civil engineer, and his mother was a high-school biology teacher. But another major influence growing up was Kredit, the science teacher who went on to recruit him. (Kredit was also a colleague of Unema’s mother.)</p><p>Kredit has won numerous awards for his work as an educator, including the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science Teaching in 2004. Like Unema, he also shares a love for the outdoors as Yellowstone National Park’s <a href=""https://www.lyndentribune.com/news/50-years-at-yellowstone-harlan-kredit-is-suspected-longest-serving-ranger-in-park-s-history/article_0311911c-18b4-11ed-95b6-97025762a862.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">longest-serving park ranger</a>. “He was an excellent science teacher, very inspiring,” says Unema.</p><p>When Unema graduated high school in 2010, he decided to enroll at his father’s alma mater, <a href=""https://www.mtu.edu/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Michigan Technological University</a>, to study engineering. He was initially unsure what discipline to follow and signed up for the general engineering course, but he quickly settled on electrical engineering.</p><p>A summer internship at a steel mill run by the multinational corporation <a href=""https://corporate.arcelormittal.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">ArcelorMittal</a> introduced Unema to factory automation and assembly lines. After graduating in 2014 he took a job at <a href=""https://www.gentex.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Gentex Corp.</a> in Zeeland, Mich., where he worked on manufacturing systems and industrial robotics.</p><h2>Diving Into Underwater Robotics</h2><p>In late 2015, he got the call from Kredit asking if he’d be interested in working on underwater robots for GFOE. The role involved not just engineering these systems, but also piloting them. Taking the plunge was a difficult choice, says Unema, as he’d just been promoted at Gentex. But the promise of travel combined with the novel engineering challenges made it too good an opportunity to turn down.</p><p>Building technology that can withstand the crushing pressure at the bottom of the ocean is tough, he says, and you have to make trade-offs between weight, size, and cost. Everything has to be waterproof, and electronics have to be carefully isolated to prevent them from grounding on the ocean floor. Some components are pressure-tolerant, but most must be stored in pressurized titanium flasks, so the components must be extremely small to minimize the size of the metallic housing.</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image""> <img alt=""Technicians operate complex control panels with multiple monitors in a dark, focused environment."" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""6cc31"" src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/technicians-operate-complex-control-panels-with-multiple-monitors-in-a-dark-focused-environment.png?id=62218876&amp;width=980"" /> <small class=""image-media media-caption"">Unema conducts predive checks from the Okeanos Explorer’s control room. Once the ROV is launched, scientists will watch the camera feeds and advise his team where to direct the vehicle.</small><small class=""image-media media-photo-credit""><a href=""https://www.art-work.global/high-seas"" target=""_blank"">Art Howard</a></small></p><p>“You’re working very closely with the mechanical engineer to fit the electronics in a really small space,” he says. “The smaller the cylinder is, the cheaper it is, but also the less mass on the vehicle. Every bit of mass means more buoyancy is required, so you want to keep things small, keep things light.”</p><p><a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/underwater-communication"" target=""_self"">Communications</a> are another challenge. The ROVs rely on several kilometers of cable containing just three single-mode optical fibers. “All the communication needs to come together and then go up one cable,” Unema says. “And every year new instruments consume more data.”</p><p>He works exclusively on ROVs that are custom made for scientific research, which require smoother control and considerably more electronics and instrumentation than the heavier-duty vehicles used by the <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-gulf-spills-lessons-for-robotics"" target=""_self"">oil and gas</a> industry. “The science ones are all hand-built, they’re all quirky,” he says.</p><p>Unema’s role spans the full life cycle of an ROV’s design, construction, and operation. He primarily spends winters upgrading and maintaining vehicles and summers piloting them on expeditions. At GFOE, he mainly worked on two ROVs for NOAA called <em><em>Deep Discoverer</em></em> and <em><em>Seirios</em></em>, which operate from the ship <em><em>Okeanos Explorer</em></em>. But he has also piloted ROVs for other organizations over the years, including the <a href=""https://schmidtocean.org/"" target=""_blank"">Schmidt Ocean Institute</a> and the <a href=""https://nautiluslive.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Ocean Exploration Trust</a>.</p><p>Unema’s new consultancy, Deep Exploration Solutions, has been given a contract to do the winter maintenance on the NOAA ROVs, and the firm is now on the lookout for more ROV design and upgrade work, as well as piloting jobs.</p><h2>An Engineer’s Life at Sea</h2><p>On expeditions, Unema is responsible for driving the robot. He follows instructions from a science team that watches the ROV’s video feed to identify things like corals, sponges, or deepwater creatures that they’d like to investigate in more detail. Sometimes he will also operate hydraulic arms to sample particularly interesting finds.</p><p>In general, the missions are aimed at discovering new species and mapping the range of known ones, says Unema. “There’s a lot of the bottom of the ocean where we don’t know anything about it,” he says. “Basically every expedition there’s some new species.”</p><p>This involves being at sea for weeks at a time. Unema says that life aboard ships can be challenging—many new crew members get seasick, and you spend almost a month living in close quarters with people you’ve often never met before. But he enjoys the opportunity to meet colleagues from a wide variety of backgrounds who are all deeply enthusiastic about the mission.</p><p>“It’s like when you go to scout camp or summer camp,” he says. “You’re all meeting new people. Everyone’s really excited to be there. We don’t know what we’re going to find.”</p><p>Unema also relishes the challenge of solving engineering problems with the <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution"" target=""_self"">limited resources available</a> on the ship. “We’re going out to the middle of the Pacific,” he says. “Things break, and you’ve got to fix them with what you have out there.”</p><p>If that sounds more exciting than daunting, and you’re interested in working with ROVs, Unema’s main advice is to talk to engineers in the field. It’s a small but friendly community, he says, so just do your research to see what opportunities are available. Some groups, such as the Ocean Exploration Trust, also operate internships for college students to help them get experience in the field.</p><p>And Unema says there are very few careers quite like it. “I love it because I get to do all aspects of engineering—from idea to operations,” he says. “To be able to take something I worked on and use it in the field is really rewarding.”</p><p><em>This article appears in the December 2025 print issue as “Levi Unema.”</em></p>",IEEE Spectrum,https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/robotics.rss,"Space Technology, Robotics, Photonics",Space Technology,N/A,N/A,"Type:departments, Underwater robots, Oceanography, Noaa, Rovs",80,True
Capacity Limits in 5G Prompt a 6G Focus on Infrastructure,https://spectrum.ieee.org/6g-network-infrastructure-bell-labs,2025-12-02T21:17:22,Margo Anderson,"<img src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/peter-vetter-smiling-in-a-nokia-bell-labs-sweatshirt.jpg?id=62261500&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C187%2C0%2C188"" /><br /><br /><p>When the head of <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/nokia-bell-labs-new-headquarters"" target=""_self"">Nokia Bell Labs</a> core research talks about “lessons learned” from <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/everything-you-need-to-know-about-5g"" target=""_self"">5G</a>, he’s doing something rare in telecom: admitting a flagship technology didn’t quite work out as planned.</p><p>That candor matters now, too, because Bell Labs core research president <a href=""https://www.nokia.com/people/peter-vetter/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Peter Vetter</a> says 6G’s success depends on getting infrastructure right the first time—something <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/5g-rollout-disappointments"" target=""_self"">5G didn’t fully do</a>.</p><p>By 2030, he says, 5G will have exhausted its capacity. <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/6g-bandwidth"" target=""_self"">Not because some 5G killer app will appear tomorrow</a>, suddenly making everyone’s phones demand 10 or 100 times as much data capacity as they require today. Rather, by the turn of the decade, wireless telecom won’t be centered around just cellphones anymore.</p><p><a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-agents"" target=""_blank"">AI agents</a>, autonomous cars, drones, IoT nodes, and sensors, sensors, sensors: Everything in a 6G world will potentially need a way on to the network. That means more than anything else in the remaining years before 6G’s anticipated rollout, high-capacity connections behind cell towers are a key game to win. Which brings industry scrutiny, then, to what telecom folks call backhaul—<a href=""https://www.trentonsystems.com/en-us/resource-hub/blog/wired-access-backhaul-vs-wireless-access-backhaul"" target=""_blank"">the high-capacity fiber or wireless links that pass data from cell towers toward the internet backbone</a>. It’s the difference between the “local” connection from your phone to a nearby tower and the “trunk” connection that carries millions of signals simultaneously. </p><p><span>But the backhaul crisis ahead isn’t just about capacity. It’s also about architecture. 5G was designed around a world where phones dominated, downloading video at higher and higher resolutions. 6G is now shaping up to be something else entirely. This inversion—from 5G’s anticipated downlink deluge to 6G’s uplink resurgence—requires rethinking everything at the core level, practically from scratch.</span></p><p>Vetter’s career spans the entire arc of the wireless telecom era—from optical interconnections in the 1990s at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcatel_Mobile"" target=""_blank"">Alcatel</a> (a research center pioneering fiber-to-home connections) to his roles at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs"" target=""_blank"">Bell Labs</a> and later Nokia Bell Labs, culminating in 2021 in his current position at the industry’s bellwether institution.</p><p>In this conversation, held in November at the <a href=""https://www.b6gs.com/"" target=""_blank"">Brooklyn 6G Summit</a> in New York, Vetter explains what 5G got wrong, what 6G must do differently, and whether these innovations can arrive before telecom’s networks start running out of room.</p><h3>5G’s Expensive Miscalculation</h3><p><strong><em>IEEE Spectrum: </em>Where is telecom today, halfway between 5G’s rollout and 6G’s anticipated rollout?</strong></p><p><strong>Peter Vetter: </strong>Today, we have enough spectrum and capacity. But going forward, there will not be enough. The 5G network by the end of the decade will run out of steam. We have traffic simulations. And it is something that has been consistent generation to generation, from 2G to 3G to 4G. Every decade, capacity goes up by about a factor of 10. So you need to prepare for that.</p><p>And the challenge for us as researchers is how do you do that in an energy-efficient way? Because the power consumption cannot go up by a factor of 10. The cost cannot go up by a factor of 10. And then, lesson learned from 5G: The idea was, “Oh, we do that in higher spectrum. There is more bandwidth. Let’s go to <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/5g-bytes-millimeter-waves-explained"" target=""_blank"">millimeter wave</a>.” The lesson learned is, okay, millimeter waves have short reach. You need a small cell [tower] every 300 meters or so. And that doesn’t cut it. It was too expensive to install all these small cells.</p><p><strong>Is this related to the backhaul question?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>So backhaul is the connection between the base station and what we call the core of the network—the data centers, and the servers. Ideally, you use fiber to your base station. If you have that fiber as a service provider, use it. It gives you the highest capacity. But very often new cell sites don’t have that fiber backhaul, then there are alternatives: wireless backhaul.</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image""> <img alt=""Close-up of a Nokia radio on glass circuit board."" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""c9af3"" src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-a-nokia-radio-on-glass-circuit-board.png?id=62261540&amp;width=980"" /> <small class=""image-media media-caption"">Nokia Bell Labs has pioneered a glass-based chip architecture for telecom’s backhaul signals, communicating between towers and telecom infrastructure.</small><small class=""image-media media-photo-credit"">Nokia</small></p><h3>Radios Built on Glass Push Frequencies Higher</h3><p><strong>What are the challenges ahead for wireless backhaul?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>To get up to the 100 gigabit per second, fiber-like speeds, you need to go to higher frequency bands.</p><p><strong>Higher frequency bands for the signals the backhaul antennas use?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>Yes. The challenge is the design of the radio front ends and the radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFICs) at those frequencies. You cannot really integrate [present-day] antennas with RFICs at those high speeds.</p><p><strong>And what happens as those signal frequencies get higher?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>So in a millimeter wave, say 28 gigahertz, you could still do [the electronics and waveguides] for this with a classical printed circuit board. But as the frequencies go up, the attenuation gets too high.</p><p><strong>What happens when you get to, say, 100 GHz?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>[Conventional materials] are no good anymore. So we need to look at other still low-cost materials. We have done pioneering work at Bell Labs on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzl0UHyRjRo"" target=""_blank"">radio on glass</a>. And we use glass not for its optical transparency, but for its transparency in the <a href=""https://www.rfwireless-world.com/terminology/sub-thz-bands-frequencies"" target=""_blank"">sub-terahertz radio range</a>.</p><p><strong>Is Nokia Bell Labs making these radio-on-glass backhaul systems for 100 GHz communications?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>I used an order of magnitude. Above 100 GHz, you need to look into a different material. But [the wavelength range] is actually 140 to 170 GHz, what is called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_band_(waveguide)"" target=""_blank"">D-Band</a>.<strong></strong></p><p>We collaborate with our internal customers to get these kind of concepts on the long-term roadmap. As an example, that D-Band radio system, we actually integrated it in a prototype with our mobile business group. And we tested it last year at the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Summer_Olympics"" target=""_blank"">Olympics in Paris</a>.<strong></strong></p><p>But this is, as I said, a prototype. We need to mature the technology between a research prototype and qualifying it to go into production. The researcher on that is <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DK2TMVgAAAAJ&amp;hl=en"" target=""_blank"">Shahriar Shahramian</a>. He’s well-known in the field for this.</p><h3>Why 6G’s Bandwidth Crisis Isn’t About Phones</h3><p><strong>What will be the applications that’ll drive the big 6G demands for bandwidth?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>We’re installing more and more cameras and other types of sensors. I mean, we’re going into a world where we want to create large world models that are synchronous copies of the physical world. So what we will see going forward in 6G is a massive-scale deployment of sensors which will feed the AI models. So a lot of uplink capacity. That’s where a lot of that increase will come from.</p><p><strong>Any others?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>Autonomous cars could be an example. It can also be in industry—like a digital twin of a harbor, and how you manage that? It can be a digital twin of a warehouse, and you query the digital twin, “Where is my product X?” Then a robot will automatically know thanks to the updated digital twin where it is in the warehouse and which route to take. Because it knows where the obstacles are in real time, thanks to that massive-scale sensing of the physical world and then the interpretation with the AI models.</p><p>You will have your agents that act on behalf of you to do your groceries, or order a driverless car. They will actively record where you are, make sure that there are also the proper privacy measures in place. So that your agent has an understanding of the state you’re in and can serve you in the most optimal way.</p><h3>How 6G Networks Will Help Detect Drones, Earthquakes, and Tsunamis</h3><p><strong>You’ve described before how 6G signals can not only transmit data but also provide sensing. How will that work?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>The augmentation now is that the network can be turned also in a sensing modality. That if you turn around the corner, a camera doesn’t see you anymore. But the radio still can detect people that are coming, for instance, at a traffic crossing. And you can anticipate that. Yeah, warn a car that, “There’s a pedestrian coming. Slow down.” We also have fiber sensing. And for instance, using fibers at the bottom of the ocean and detecting movements of waves and detect tsunamis, for instance, and do an early tsunami warning.</p><p><strong>What are your teams’ findings?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>The present-day use of tsunami warning buoys are a <a href=""https://phys.org/news/2024-12-tsunami-buoys-safeguarding-thailand.html"" target=""_blank"">few hundred kilometers offshore</a>. These tsunami waves travel at 300 and more meters per second, and so you only have 15 minutes to warn the people and evacuate. If you have now a fiber sensing network across the ocean that you can detect it much deeper in the ocean, you can do meaningful early tsunami warning.</p><p>We recently detected there was a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Kamchatka_earthquake"" target=""_blank"">major earthquake in East Russia</a>. That was last July. And we had a fiber sensing system between Hawaii and California. And we were able to see that earthquake on the fiber. And we also saw the development of the tsunami wave.</p><h3>6G’s Thousands of Antennas and Smarter Waveforms</h3><p><strong>Bell Labs was an early pioneer in multiple-input, multiple-output (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIMO"" target=""_blank"">MIMO</a>) antennas starting in the 1990s. Where multiple transmit and receive antennas could carry many data streams at once. What is Bell Labs doing with MIMO now to help solve these bandwidth problems you’ve described?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>So, as I said earlier, you want to provide capacity from existing cell sites. And the way to MIMO can do that by a technology called a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamforming"" target=""_blank"">simplified beamforming</a>: If you want better coverage at a higher frequency, you need to focus your electromagnetic energy, your radio energy, even more. So in order to do that, you need a larger amount of antennas.</p><p>So if you double the frequency, we go from 3.5 gigahertz, which is the <a href=""https://www.digi.com/blog/post/what-is-c-band-and-why-is-it-important-for-5g"" target=""_blank"">C-band in 5G</a>, now to 6G, 7 gigahertz. So it’s about double. That means the wavelength is half. So you can fit four times more antenna elements in the same form factor. So physics helps us in that sense.</p><p><strong>What’s the catch?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>Where physics doesn’t help us is more antenna elements means more signal processing, and the power consumption goes up. So here is where the research then comes in. Can we creatively get to these larger antenna arrays without the power consumption going up?<strong></strong></p><p>The use of AI is important in this. How can we leverage AI to do channel estimation, to do such things as equalization, to do smart beamforming, to learn the waveform, for instance?</p><p>We’ve shown that with these kind of AI techniques, we can get actually up to 30 percent more capacity on the same spectrum.</p><p><strong>And that allows many gigabits per second to go out to each phone or device?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>So gigabits per second is already possible in 5G. We’ve demonstrated that. You can imagine that this could go up, but that’s not really the need. The need is really how many more can you support from a base station?</p>",IEEE Spectrum,https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss,"Robotics, Semiconductors, Photonics",Robotics,N/A,N/A,"6g, Ai agents, Autonomous cars, Digital twin, Drones, Nokia bell labs",80,True

That approach delivered astonishing breakthroughs in <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/large-language-models"" target=""_blank"">large language models</a> (LLMs); </span><span>i</span><span>n just five years, </span><span>AI has </span><span>leapt from models like GPT-2, which could hardly mimic coherence, to systems like GPT-5 </span><span>that </span><span>can reason and engage in substantive dialogue. And now early prototypes of AI agents that can navigate codebases or </span><a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-agents-computer-use"" target=""_self"">browse the web</a><span> point towards an entirely new frontier.</span></p><p>But size alone can only take AI so far. The next leap won’t come from bigger models alone<span>. I</span>t will come from combining ever-better data with worlds we build for models to learn in. And the most important question <span>becomes: What do classrooms for AI look like?</span></p><p><span>In the past few</span> month<span>s</span> Silicon Valley has placed its bets, <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/21/silicon-valley-bets-big-on-environments-to-train-ai-agents/"" target=""_blank""><span>with labs investing billions</span></a> in constructing <span>such </span>classrooms, which are called reinforcement learning (RL) environments. These environments let machines experiment, fail, and improve in realistic digital spaces. </p><h2>AI Training: From Data to Experience</h2><p>The history of modern AI has unfolded in eras, each defined by the kind of data that the models consumed. First came the age of pretraining on internet-scale datasets. This commodity data allowed machines to mimic human language by recognizing statistical patterns. Then came  <span>data combined</span> with reinforcement learning from human feedback—a technique that uses crowd workers to grade responses from LLMs—which made AI more useful, responsive, and aligned with human preferences.<br /></p><p>We have experienced both eras firsthand. Working in the trenches of model data <span>at <a href=""https://scale.com/"" target=""_blank"">Scale AI</a></span> exposed us to what many consider the fundamental problem in AI: ensuring that the <span>training </span>data fueling these models is diverse, accurate, and effective in driving performance gains. Systems trained on clean, structured, expert-labeled data made leaps. Cracking the data problem allowed us to pioneer some of the most critical advancements in LLMs over the past few years.</p><p>Today, data is still a foundation. It is the raw material from which intelligence is built. But we are entering a new phase where data alone is no longer enough. To unlock the next frontier, we must pair high-quality data with environments that allow limitless interaction, continuous feedback, and learning through action. RL environments don’t replace data; they amplify what data can do by enabling models to apply knowledge, test hypotheses, and refine behaviors in realistic settings.</p><h2>How an RL Environment Works</h2><p>In an RL environment, the model learns through a simple loop: it observes the state of the world, takes an action, and receives a reward that indicates whether that action helped accomplish a goal. Over many iterations, the model gradually discovers strategies that lead to better outcomes. The crucial shift is that training becomes interactive—models aren’t just predicting the next token but improving through trial, error, and feedback.</p><p>For example, language models can already generate code in a simple chat setting. Place them in a live coding environment<span>—</span>where they can ingest context, run their code, debug errors, and refine their solution<span>—</span>and something changes. They shift from advising to autonomously <span>problem-</span>solving.</p><p>This distinction matters. In a software-driven world, the ability for AI to generate and test production-level code in vast repositories will mark a <span>major</span> change in capability. That leap won’t come solely from larger datasets; it will come from immersive environments where agents can experiment, stumble, and learn through iteration—much like human programmers do. The real world of development is messy: Coders have to deal with underspecified bugs, tangled codebases, vague requirements. Teaching AI to handle that mess is the only way it will ever graduate from producing error-prone attempts to generating consistent and reliable solutions.</p><h2>Can AI Handle the Messy Real World?</h2><p>Navigating the internet is also messy. Pop-ups, login walls, broken links, and outdated information are woven throughout day-to-day browsing workflows. Humans handle these disruptions almost instinctively, but AI can only develop that capability by training in environments that simulate the web’s unpredictability. Agents must learn how to recover from errors, recognize and persist through user-interface obstacles, and complete multi-step workflows across widely used applications.</p><p>Some of the most important environments aren’t public at all. Governments and enterprises are actively building secure simulations where AI can practice high-stakes decision-making without real-world consequences. Consider disaster relief: It would be unthinkable to deploy an untested agent in a live hurricane response. But in a simulated world of ports, roads, and supply chains, an agent can fail a thousand times and gradually get better at crafting the optimal plan.</p><p>Every major leap in AI has relied on unseen infrastructure, such as annotators labeling datasets, researchers training reward models, and engineers building scaffoldings for LLMs to use tools and take action. <span>Finding l</span>arge-volume and high-quality datasets <span>was </span>once the bottleneck in AI, and solving that problem sparked the previous wave of progress. Today, the bottleneck is not data—it’s building RL environments that are rich, realistic, and truly useful.</p><p><span>The next phase of AI progress</span> won’t be an accident of scale. It will be the result of combining strong data foundations with interactive environments that teach machines how to act, adapt, and reason across messy real-world scenarios. Coding sandboxes, OS and browser playgrounds, and secure simulations will turn prediction into competence.</p>",IEEE Spectrum,https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss,"Space Technology, Robotics, Fusion Energy",Space Technology,N/A,N/A,"Reinforcement learning, Agentic ai, Llms, Training data",80,True

While working on assembly lines at an automotive parts supplier in 2015, he got a surprise call from his high-school science teacher that set him off on an entirely new path: piloting underwater robots to explore <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/underwater-robotics"" target=""_self"">the ocean’s deepest abysses</a>.</p><p>That call came from <a href=""https://nthf.org/inductees/harlan-kredit/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Harlan Kredit</a>, a nationally renowned science teacher and board member of a Rhode Island-based nonprofit called the <a href=""https://www.engineeringfordiscovery.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Global Foundation for Ocean Exploration</a> (GFOE). The organization was looking for an electrical engineer to help design, build, and pilot remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) for the U.S. <a href=""https://www.noaa.gov/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>.</p><h3>Levi Unema</h3><br /><p><strong></strong><strong>Employer</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Deep Exploration Solutions</p><p><strong>Occupation</strong></p><p><strong></strong>ROV engineer</p><p><strong>Education  </strong></p><p>Bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering, Michigan Technological University</p><p>This was an exciting break for Unema, a Washington state native who had grown up tinkering with electronics and exploring the outdoors. Unema joined the team in early 2016 and has since helped develop and operate deep-sea robots for scientific expeditions around the globe.</p><p>The GFOE’s contract with NOAA expired in July, forcing the engineering team to disband. But soon after, Unema teamed up with four former colleagues to start their own ROV consultancy, called <a href=""https://deepexplorationsolutions.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Deep Exploration Solutions</a>, to continue the work he’s so passionate about.</p><p>“I love the exploration and just seeing new things every day,” he says. “And the engineering challenges that go along with it are really exciting, because there’s a lot of pressure down there and a lot of technical problems to solve.”</p><h2>Nature and Technology</h2><p>Unema’s fascination with electronics started early. Growing up in Lynden, Wash., he took apart radios, modified headphones, and hacked together USB chargers from AA batteries. “I’ve always had to know how things work,” he says. He was also a Boy Scout, and much of his youth was spent hiking, camping, and snowboarding.</p><p>That love of both technology and nature can be traced back, at least in part, to his parents—his father was a civil engineer, and his mother was a high-school biology teacher. But another major influence growing up was Kredit, the science teacher who went on to recruit him. (Kredit was also a colleague of Unema’s mother.)</p><p>Kredit has won numerous awards for his work as an educator, including the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science Teaching in 2004. Like Unema, he also shares a love for the outdoors as Yellowstone National Park’s <a href=""https://www.lyndentribune.com/news/50-years-at-yellowstone-harlan-kredit-is-suspected-longest-serving-ranger-in-park-s-history/article_0311911c-18b4-11ed-95b6-97025762a862.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">longest-serving park ranger</a>. “He was an excellent science teacher, very inspiring,” says Unema.</p><p>When Unema graduated high school in 2010, he decided to enroll at his father’s alma mater, <a href=""https://www.mtu.edu/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Michigan Technological University</a>, to study engineering. He was initially unsure what discipline to follow and signed up for the general engineering course, but he quickly settled on electrical engineering.</p><p>A summer internship at a steel mill run by the multinational corporation <a href=""https://corporate.arcelormittal.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">ArcelorMittal</a> introduced Unema to factory automation and assembly lines. After graduating in 2014 he took a job at <a href=""https://www.gentex.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Gentex Corp.</a> in Zeeland, Mich., where he worked on manufacturing systems and industrial robotics.</p><h2>Diving Into Underwater Robotics</h2><p>In late 2015, he got the call from Kredit asking if he’d be interested in working on underwater robots for GFOE. The role involved not just engineering these systems, but also piloting them. Taking the plunge was a difficult choice, says Unema, as he’d just been promoted at Gentex. But the promise of travel combined with the novel engineering challenges made it too good an opportunity to turn down.</p><p>Building technology that can withstand the crushing pressure at the bottom of the ocean is tough, he says, and you have to make trade-offs between weight, size, and cost. Everything has to be waterproof, and electronics have to be carefully isolated to prevent them from grounding on the ocean floor. Some components are pressure-tolerant, but most must be stored in pressurized titanium flasks, so the components must be extremely small to minimize the size of the metallic housing.</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image""> <img alt=""Technicians operate complex control panels with multiple monitors in a dark, focused environment."" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""6cc31"" src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/technicians-operate-complex-control-panels-with-multiple-monitors-in-a-dark-focused-environment.png?id=62218876&amp;width=980"" /> <small class=""image-media media-caption"">Unema conducts predive checks from the Okeanos Explorer’s control room.

Every bit of mass means more buoyancy is required, so you want to keep things small, keep things light.”</p><p><a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/underwater-communication"" target=""_self"">Communications</a> are another challenge. The ROVs rely on several kilometers of cable containing just three single-mode optical fibers. “All the communication needs to come together and then go up one cable,” Unema says. “And every year new instruments consume more data.”</p><p>He works exclusively on ROVs that are custom made for scientific research, which require smoother control and considerably more electronics and instrumentation than the heavier-duty vehicles used by the <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-gulf-spills-lessons-for-robotics"" target=""_self"">oil and gas</a> industry. “The science ones are all hand-built, they’re all quirky,” he says.</p><p>Unema’s role spans the full life cycle of an ROV’s design, construction, and operation. He primarily spends winters upgrading and maintaining vehicles and summers piloting them on expeditions. At GFOE, he mainly worked on two ROVs for NOAA called <em><em>Deep Discoverer</em></em> and <em><em>Seirios</em></em>, which operate from the ship <em><em>Okeanos Explorer</em></em>. But he has also piloted ROVs for other organizations over the years, including the <a href=""https://schmidtocean.org/"" target=""_blank"">Schmidt Ocean Institute</a> and the <a href=""https://nautiluslive.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Ocean Exploration Trust</a>.</p><p>Unema’s new consultancy, Deep Exploration Solutions, has been given a contract to do the winter maintenance on the NOAA ROVs, and the firm is now on the lookout for more ROV design and upgrade work, as well as piloting jobs.</p><h2>An Engineer’s Life at Sea</h2><p>On expeditions, Unema is responsible for driving the robot. He follows instructions from a science team that watches the ROV’s video feed to identify things like corals, sponges, or deepwater creatures that they’d like to investigate in more detail. Sometimes he will also operate hydraulic arms to sample particularly interesting finds.</p><p>In general, the missions are aimed at discovering new species and mapping the range of known ones, says Unema. “There’s a lot of the bottom of the ocean where we don’t know anything about it,” he says. “Basically every expedition there’s some new species.”</p><p>This involves being at sea for weeks at a time. Unema says that life aboard ships can be challenging—many new crew members get seasick, and you spend almost a month living in close quarters with people you’ve often never met before. But he enjoys the opportunity to meet colleagues from a wide variety of backgrounds who are all deeply enthusiastic about the mission.</p><p>“It’s like when you go to scout camp or summer camp,” he says. “You’re all meeting new people. Everyone’s really excited to be there. We don’t know what we’re going to find.”</p><p>Unema also relishes the challenge of solving engineering problems with the <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution"" target=""_self"">limited resources available</a> on the ship. “We’re going out to the middle of the Pacific,” he says. “Things break, and you’ve got to fix them with what you have out there.”</p><p>If that sounds more exciting than daunting, and you’re interested in working with ROVs, Unema’s main advice is to talk to engineers in the field. It’s a small but friendly community, he says, so just do your research to see what opportunities are available. Some groups, such as the Ocean Exploration Trust, also operate internships for college students to help them get experience in the field.</p><p>And Unema says there are very few careers quite like it. “I love it because I get to do all aspects of engineering—from idea to operations,” he says. “To be able to take something I worked on and use it in the field is really rewarding.”</p><p><em>This article appears in the December 2025 print issue as “Levi Unema.”</em></p>",IEEE Spectrum,https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss,"Space Technology, Robotics, Photonics",Space Technology,N/A,N/A,"Type:departments, Underwater robots, Oceanography, Noaa, Rovs",80,True

Here’s why:</p><ul><li>If you’re earlier in your career, you frankly don’t have much political power in the organization. Any arguments to change team culture or address systemic problems will likely fall on deaf ears. You’ll end up frustrated, and your efforts will be wasted.</li><li>If you’re more senior, you have some ability to improve processes and relationships on the team. However, if you’re an individual contributor (IC), your capabilities are still limited. There is likely some “low-hanging fruit” of quick improvements to suggest. A few thoughtful pieces of feedback could address many of the problems. If you’ve done that and things are still not getting better, it’s probably time to leave.</li><li>If you’re part of upper management, you may have inherited the problem, or maybe you were even brought in to solve it. This is the rare case where you could consider the change scenario and address the broken culture: You have both the context and power to make a difference.</li></ul><p>The world of technology is large, and constantly getting larger. Don’t waste your time on a bad team or with a bad manager. Find another team, company, or start something on your own.</p><p>Engineers often hesitate to leave a poor work environment because they’re afraid or unsure about the process of finding something new. That’s a valid concern. However, inertia should not be the reason you stick around in a job. The best careers stem from the excitement of actively choosing your work, not tolerating toxicity.</p><p>Finally, it’s worth noting that even in a toxic team, you’ll still come across smart and kind people. If you are stuck on a bad team, seek out the people who match your wavelength.

This Toy Electric Stove Was Dangerously Realistic,https://spectrum.ieee.org/electric-toy-stoves,2025-11-30T13:00:01,Allison Marsh,"<img src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-an-old-fashioned-yellow-and-green-stove-and-oven-with-a-logo-that-says-lionel.jpg?id=62219513&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C250%2C0%2C251"" /><br /><br /><p>Introduced in 1930 by <a href=""https://www.lionel.com/about"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Lionel Corp.</a>—better known for its electric model trains—the fully functional toy stove shown at top had two electric burners and an oven that heated to 260 °C. It came with a set of cookware, including a frying pan, a pot with lid, a muffin tin, a tea kettle, and a wooden potato masher. I would have also expected a spoon, whisk, or spatula, but maybe most girls already had those. Just plug in the toy, and housewives-in-training could mimic their mothers frying eggs, baking muffins, or boiling water for tea.</p><h2>A brief history of toy stoves</h2><p>Even before electrification, cast-iron toy stoves had become popular in the mid-19th century. At first fueled by coal or alcohol and later by oil or gas, these toy stoves were scaled-down working equivalents of the real thing. Girls could use their stoves along with a toy waffle iron or small skillet to whip up breakfast. If that wasn’t enough fun, they could heat up a miniature flatiron and iron their dolls’ clothes. Designed to help girls understand their domestic duties, these toys were the gendered equivalent of their brothers’ <a href=""https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object/nmah_847046"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">toy steam engines</a>. If you’re thinking fossil-fuel-powered “educational toys” are a recipe for disaster, you are correct. Many children suffered serious burns and sometimes death by literally playing with fire. Then again, people in the 1950s thought <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/fun-and-uranium-for-the-whole-family-in-this-1950s-science-kit"" target=""_self"">playing with uranium</a> was safe.</p><p>When electric toy stoves came on the scene in the 1910s, things didn’t get much safer, as the new entrants also lacked basic safety features. The burners on the 1930 Lionel range, for example, could only be turned off or on, but at least kids weren’t cooking over an open flame. At 86 centimeters tall, the Lionel range was also significantly larger than its more diminutive predecessors. Just the right height for young children to cook standing up.</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image""> <img alt=""Photo of a black and silver toy electric stove with two pots plus a book entitled Western Electric Junior Cook Book"" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""2fd9c"" src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-black-and-silver-toy-electric-stove-with-two-pots-plus-a-book-entitled-western-electric-junior-cook-book.jpg?id=62219520&amp;width=980"" /> <small class=""image-media media-caption"">Western Electric’s Junior Electric Range was demonstrated at an expo in 1915 in New York City.</small><small class=""image-media media-photo-credit"">The Strong</small></p><p>Well before the Lionel stove, the Western Electric Co. had a cohort of girls demonstrating its Junior Electric Range at the Electrical Exposition held in New York City in 1915. The Junior Electric held its own in a display of regular sewing-machine motors, vacuum cleaners, and electric washing machines.</p><p>The Junior Electric stood about 30 cm tall with six burners and an oven. The electric cord plugged into a light fixture socket. Children played with it while sitting on the floor or as it sat on a table. A visitor to the Expo declared the miniature range “the greatest electrical novelty in years.” Cooking by electricity in any form was still innovative—George A. Hughes had introduced his eponymous electric range just five years earlier. When the Junior Electric came along, <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2016/article/the-life-of-american-workers-in-1915.htm"" target=""_blank"">less than a third of U.S. households</a> had been wired for electric lights.</p><h2>How electricity turned cooking into a science</h2><p>One reason to give little girls working toy stoves was so they could learn how to differentiate between a hot flame and low heat and get a feel for cooking without burning the food. These are skills that come with experience. Directions like “bake until done in a moderate oven,” a common line in 19th-century recipes, require a lot more tacit knowledge than is needed to, say, throw together a modern boxed brownie mix. The latter comes with detailed instructions and assumes you can control your oven temperature to within a few degrees. That type of precision simply didn’t exist in the 19th century, in large part because it was so difficult to calibrate wood- or coal-burning appliances. Girls needed to start young to master these skills by the time they married and were expected to handle the household cooking on their own.</p><p>Electricity changed the game.</p><p>In his comparison of “fireless cookers,” an engineer named <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6590440"" target=""_blank"">Percy Wilcox Gumaer</a> exhaustively tested four different electric ovens and then presented his findings at the 32nd Annual Convention of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (a forerunner of today’s IEEE) on 2 July 1915. At the time, metered electricity was more expensive than gas or coal, so Gumaer investigated the most economical form of cooking with electricity, comparing different approaches such as longer cooking at low heat versus faster cooking in a hotter oven, the effect of heat loss when opening the oven door, and the benefits of searing meat on the stovetop versus in the oven before making a roast.</p><p>Gumaer wasn’t starting from scratch. Similar to how Yoshitada Minami needed to learn the ideal rice recipe before he could design an <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/toshiba-rice-cooker"" target=""_self"">automatic rice cooker</a>, Gumaer decided that he needed to understand the principles of roasting beef. Minami had turned to his wife, Fumiko, who spent five years researching and testing variations of rice cooking. Gumaer turned to the work of Elizabeth C. Sprague, a research assistant in nutrition investigations at the University of Illinois, and H.S. Grindley, a professor of general chemistry there.</p><p>In their 1907 publication “<a href=""https://archive.org/details/cu31924003582503"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">A Precise Method of Roasting Beef</a>,” Sprague and Grindley had defined qualitative terms like medium rare and well done by precisely measuring the internal temperature in the center of the roast. They concluded that beef could be roasted at an oven temperature between 100 and 200 °C.</p><p>Continuing that investigation, Gumaer tested 22 roasts at 100, 120, 140, 160, and 180 °C, measuring the time they took to reach rare, medium rare, and well done, and calculating the cost per kilowatt-hour. He repeated his tests for biscuits, bread, and sponge cake.</p><p>In case you’re wondering, Gumaer determined that cooking with electricity could be a few cents cheaper than other methods if you roasted the beef at 120 °C instead of 180 °C. It’s also more cost-effective to sear beef on the stovetop rather than in the oven. Biscuits tasted best when baked at 200 to 240 °C, while sponge cake was best between 170 and 200 °C. Bread was better at 180 to 240 °C, but too many other factors affected its quality. In true electrical engineering fashion, Gumaer concluded that “it is possible to reduce the art of cooking with electricity to an exact science.”</p><h2>Electric toy stoves as educational tools</h2><p>This semester, I’m teaching an introductory class on women’s and gender studies, and I told my students about the Lionel toy oven. They were horrified by the inherent danger. One incredulous student kept asking, “This is real? This is not a joke?” Instead of learning to cook with a toy that could heat to 260 °C, many of us grew up with the Easy-Bake Oven. The 1969 model could reach about 177° C with its two 100-watt incandescent light bulbs. That was still hot enough to cause burns, but somehow it seemed safer. (Since 2011, Easy-Bakes have used a heating element instead of lightbulbs.)</p><p class=""shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image""> <img alt=""Photo of a box for a purple and green toy oven."" class=""rm-shortcode"" id=""15cbd"" src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-box-for-a-purple-and-green-toy-oven.jpg?id=62219526&amp;width=980"" /> <small class=""image-media media-caption"">The Queasy Bake Cookerator, designed to whip up “gross-looking, great-tasting snacks,” was marketed to boys. </small><small class=""image-media media-photo-credit"">The Strong</small></p><p>The Easy-Bake I had wasn’t particularly gendered. It was orange and brown and meant to look like a different new-fangled appliance of the day, the microwave oven. But by the time my students were playing with Easy-Bake Ovens, the models were in the girly hues of pink and purple. In 2002, Hasbro briefly tried to lure boys by releasing the <a href=""https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/oven-queasy-bake-cookerator-hasbro-inc/EAGAnW_bfiaP1A"" target=""_blank"">Queasy Bake Cookerator</a>, which the company marketed with disgusting-sounding foods like Chocolate Crud Cake and Mucky Mud. The campaign didn’t work, and the toy was soon withdrawn.</p><p>Similarly, Lionel’s electric toy range didn’t last long on the market. Launched in 1930, it had been discontinued by 1932, but that may have had more to do with timing. The toy cost US $29.50, the equivalent of a men’s suit, a new bed, or a month’s rent. In the midst of a global depression, the toy stove was an extravagance. Lionel reverted to selling electric trains to boys.</p><p>My students discussed whether cooking is still a gendered activity. Although they agreed that meal prep disproportionately falls on women even now, they acknowledged the rise of the male chef and credited televised cooking shows with closing the gender gap. As a surprise, we discovered that one of the students in the class, Haley Mattes, competed in and <a href=""https://www.ciachef.edu/blog/keeping-chopped-junior-winner-haley-mattes/"" target=""_blank"">won <em><em>Chopped Junior</em></em></a> as a 12-year-old.</p><p>Haley had a play kitchen as a kid that was entirely fake: fake food, fake pans, fake utensils.

3 Weird Things You Can Turn Into a Memristor,https://spectrum.ieee.org/memristor-materials,2025-11-27T15:00:01,Perri Thaler,"<img src=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/conceptual-collage-of-memristor-symbols-filled-with-the-textures-of-mushrooms-honey-and-blood.jpg?id=62243597&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C62%2C0%2C63"" /><br /><br /><p>From the <a href=""#honey"">honey</a> in your tea to the <a href=""#blood"">blood</a> in your veins, materials all around you have a hidden talent. Some of these substances, when engineered in specific ways, can act as memristors—electrical components that can “remember” past states. </p><p>Memristors are often used in chips that both perform computations and store data. They are devices that store data as particular levels of resistance. Today, they are constructed as a thin layer of titanium dioxide or similar dielectric material sandwiched between two metal electrodes. Applying enough voltage to the device causes tiny regions in the dielectric layer—where oxygen atoms are missing—to form filaments that bridge the electrodes or otherwise move in a way that makes the layer more conductive. Reversing the voltage undoes the process. Thus, the process essentially gives the memristor a memory of past electrical activity.</p><p>Last month, while exploring the electrical properties of fungi, a group at The Ohio State University found first-hand that some organic memristors have benefits beyond those made with conventional materials. Not only can <a href=""https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">shiitake act as a memristor</a>, for example, but it may be useful in aerospace or medical applications because the fungus demonstrates high levels of radiation resistance. The project “really mushroomed into something cool,” lead researcher <a href=""https://si.osu.edu/john-larocco"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">John LaRocco</a> says with a smirk.</p><p>Researchers have learned that other unexpected materials may give memristors an edge. They may be more flexible than typical memristors or even biodegradable. Here’s how they’ve made memristors from strange materials, and the potential benefits these odd devices could bring:</p><h2>Mushrooms</h2><p>LaRocco and his colleagues were searching for a proxy for brain circuitry to use in electrical stimulation research when they stumbled upon something interesting—shiitake mushrooms are capable of learning in a way that’s similar to <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/memristor-random"" target=""_self"">memristors</a>.</p><p>The group set out to evaluate just how well shiitake can remember electrical states by first cultivating nine samples and curating optimal growing conditions, including feeding them a mix of farro, wheat, and hay.</p><p>Once fully matured, the mushrooms were dried and rehydrated to a level that made them moderately conductive. In this state, the fungi’s structure includes conductive pathways that emulate the oxygen vacancies in commercial memristors. The scientists plugged them into circuits and put them through voltage, frequency, and memory tests. The result? Mushroom memristors.</p><p>It may smell “kind of funny,” LaRocco says, but shiitake performs surprisingly well when compared to conventional memristors. Around 90 percent of the time, the fungus maintains ideal memristor-like behavior for signals up to 5.85 kilohertz. While traditional materials can function at frequencies orders of magnitude faster, these numbers are notable for biological materials, he says. </p><p>What fungi lack in performance, they may make up for in other properties. For one, many mushrooms—including shiitake—are highly resistant to radiation and other environmental dangers. “They’re growing in logs in <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/24-hours-at-fukushima"" target=""_blank"">Fukushima</a> and a lot of very rough parts of the world, so that’s one of the appeals,” LaRocco says.</p><p>Shiitake are also an environmentally-friendly option that’s already commercialized. “They’re already cultured in large quantities,” LaRocco explains. “One could simply leverage existing logistics chains” if the industry wanted to commercialize mushroom memristors. The use cases for this product would be niche, he thinks, and would center around the radiation resistance that shiitake boasts. Mushroom <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/nvidia-h100-space"" target=""_self"">GPUs</a> are unlikely, LaRocco says, but he sees potential for aerospace and medical applications.</p><h2 class=""rm-anchors"" id=""honey"">Honey</h2><p>In 2022, engineers at Washington State University interested in green electronics set out to <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/ac585b"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">study</a> if honey could serve as a good memristor. “Modern electronics generate 50 million tons of <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/e-waste"" target=""_self"">e-waste</a> annually, with only about 20 percent recycled,” says <a href=""https://ece.mst.edu/people/faculty-directory/fengzhao/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Feng Zhao</a>, who led the work and is now at Missouri University of Science and Technology. “Honey offers a biodegradable alternative.”</p><p>The researchers first blended commercial honey with water and stored it in a vacuum to remove air bubbles. They then spread the mixture on a piece of copper, baked the whole stack at 90 °C for nine hours to stabilize it, and, finally, capped it with circular copper electrodes on top—completing the honey-based memristor sandwich.</p><p>The resulting 2.5-micrometer-thick honey layer acted like oxide dielectric in conventional memristors: a place for conductive pathways to form and dissolve, changing resistance with voltage. In this setup, when voltage is applied, copper filaments extend through the honey.</p><p>The honey-based memristor was able to switch from low to high resistance in 500 nanoseconds and back to low in 100 nanoseconds, which is comparable to speeds in <a href=""https://pubs.aip.org/aip/ape/article/2/4/040901/3323360/Emerging-materials-for-resistive-switching"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">some non-food-based memristive materials</a>. </p><p>One advantage of honey is that it’s “cheap and widely available, making it an attractive candidate for scalable fabrication,” Zhao says. It’s also “fully biodegradable and dissolves in water, showing zero toxic waste.” In the 2022 paper, though, the researchers note that for a honey-based device to be truly biodegradable, the copper components would need to be replaced with dissolvable metals. They suggest options like magnesium and tungsten, but also write that the performance of memristors made from these metals is still “under investigation.”</p><h2 class=""rm-anchors"" id=""blood"">Blood</h2><p>Considering it a potential means of delivering healthcare, a group in India <a href=""https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJMEI.2011.039073"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">wondered</a> if blood would make a good memristor in 2011, just three years after the<a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-we-found-the-missing-memristor"" target=""_blank""> first memristor</a> was built.</p><p>The experiments were pretty simple. The researchers filled a test tube with fresh, type O+ human blood and inserted two conducting wire probes. The wires were connected with a power supply, creating a complete circuit, and voltages of one, two, and three volts were applied in repeated steps. Then, to test the memristor-qualities of blood as it exists in the human body, the researchers set up a “flow mode” that applied voltage to the blood as it flowed from a tube at up to one drop per second.</p><p>The experiments were preliminary and only measured current passing through the blood, but resistance could be set by applying voltage. Crucially, resistance changed by less than 10 percent in the 30 minute period after voltage was applied. In the <em><em>International Journal of Medical Engineering and Informatics</em></em>, the scientists wrote that, because of these observations, their contraption “looks like a human blood memristor.”</p><br />They suggested that this knowledge could be useful in treating illness. Sick people may have ion imbalances in certain parts of their bodies—instead of prescribing medication, why not employ a circuit component made of human tissue to solve the problem? In recent years, blood-based memristors have been tested by other scientists as means to treat conditions ranging from <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590006424002308?via%3Dihub"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">high blood sugar</a> to <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590006425009214?via%3Dihub"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">nearsightedness</a>.",IEEE Spectrum,https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss,"Space Technology, Semiconductors",Space Technology,N/A,N/A,"Memristors, Blood, Green electronics, Biodegradable electronics, Radiation hardening",65,True

I didn’t really know what I wanted to do, but I took a remote sensing class my second semester of senior year that I just loved. When I graduated, [George Washington University professor (then at Washington University in St. Louis)] <a href=""https://cs.engineering.gwu.edu/robert-pless"" target=""_blank"">Robert Pless</a> hired me to work on a program called <a href=""https://www.iarpa.gov/research-programs/finder"" target=""_blank"">Finder</a>. </p><p>The goal of Finder was to say, if you have a picture and nothing else, how can you figure out where that picture was taken? My family knew about the work that I was doing, and [in 2013] my uncle shared an article in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch with me about a young murder victim from the 1980s whose case had run cold. [The St. Louis Police Department] never figured out who she was. </p><p>What they had was pictures from the burial in 1983. They were wanting to do an exhumation of her remains to do modern forensic analysis, figure out what part of the country she was from. But they had exhumed the remains underneath her headstone at the cemetery and it wasn’t her. </p><p>And they [dug up the wrong remains] two more times, at which point the medical examiner for St. Louis said, “You can’t keep digging until you have evidence of where the remains actually are.” My uncle sends this to me, and he’s like, “Hey, could you figure out where this picture was taken?” </p><p>And so we actually ended up consulting for the St. Louis Police Department to take this tool we were building for <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/where-was-this-photo-taken"" target=""_self"">geolocalization</a> to see if we could find the location of this lost grave. We submitted a report to the medical examiner for St. Louis that said, “Here is where we believe the remains are.” </p><p>And we were right. We were able to <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6913722"" target=""_blank"">exhume her remains</a>. They were able to do modern forensic analysis and figure out she was from the Southeast. We’ve still not figured out her identity, but we have a lot better genetic information at this point. </p><p>For me, that moment was like, “This is what I want to do with my life. I want to use computer vision to do some good.” That was a tipping point for me.</p><p><a href=""#top"">Back to top</a></p><p id=""algo""><strong>So how does your algorithm work? Can you walk me through how a user-uploaded photo becomes usable data for law enforcement?</strong></p><p><strong>Stylianou: </strong>There are two really key pieces when we think about AI systems today. One is the data, and one is the model you’re using to operate. For us, both of those are equally important. </p><p>First is the data. We’re really lucky that there’s tons of imagery of hotels on the Internet, and so we’re able to scrape publicly available data in large volume. We have millions of these images that are available online. The problem with a lot of those images, though, is that they’re like advertising images. They’re perfect images of the nicest hotel in the room—they’re really clean, and that isn’t what the victim images look like. </p><p>A victim image is often a selfie that the victim has taken themselves. They’re in a messy room. The lighting is imperfect. This is a problem for machine learning algorithms. We call it the domain gap. When there is a gap between the data that you trained your model on and the data that you’re running through at inference time, your model won’t perform very well. </p><p>This idea to build the TraffickCam mobile application was in large part to supplement that Internet data with data that actually looks more like the victim imagery. We built this app so that people, when they travel, can submit pictures of their hotel rooms specifically for this purpose. Those pictures, combined with the pictures that we have off the Internet, are what we use to train our model. </p><p><strong>Then what?</strong></p><p><strong>Stylianou: </strong>Once we have a big pile of data, we train neural networks to learn to embed it. If you take an image and run it through your <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/what-is-deep-learning/step-1"" target=""_self"">neural network</a>, what comes out on the other end isn’t explicitly a prediction of what hotel the image came from. Rather, it’s a numerical representation [of image features]. </p><p><span>What we have is a neural network that takes in images and spits out vectors—small numerical representations of those images—where images that come from the same place hopefully have similar representations. That’s what we then use in this investigative platform that we have deployed at [NCMEC].</span></p><p>We have a search interface that uses that deep learning model, where an analyst can put in their image, run it through there, and they get back a set of results of what are the other images that are visually similar, and you can use that to then infer the location.</p><p><a href=""#top"">Back to top</a></p><h2>Identifying Hotel Rooms Using Computer Vision</h2><p id=""hotels""><strong>Many of your papers mention that matching hotel room images can actually be more difficult than matching photos of other types of locations. Why is that, and how do you deal with those challenges?</strong></p><p><strong>Stylianou: </strong>There are a handful of things that are really unique about hotels compared to other domains. Two different hotels may actually look really similar—every Motel 6 in the country has been renovated so that it looks virtually identical. That’s a real challenge for these models that are trying to come up with different representations for different hotels. </p><p>On the flip side, two rooms in the same hotel may look really different. You have the penthouse suite and the entry-level room. Or a renovation has happened on one floor and not another. That’s really a challenge when two images should have the same representation.</p><p>Other parts of our queries are unique because usually there’s a very, very large part of the image that has to be erased first. We’re talking about child pornography images. That has to be erased before it ever gets submitted to our system.</p><p>We trained the first version<strong> </strong>by pasting in people-shaped blobs to try and get the network to ignore the erased portion. But [Temple University professor and close collaborator <a href=""https://cis.temple.edu/~souvenir/"" target=""_blank"">Richard Souvenir</a>’s team] showed that if you actually use AI in-painting—you actually fill in that blob with a sort of natural-looking texture—you actually do a lot better on the search than if you leave the erased blob in there.</p><p>So when our analysts run their search, the first thing they do is they erase the image. The next thing that we do is that we actually then go and use an AI in-painting model to fill that back in. </p><p><a href=""#top"">Back to top</a></p><p id=""image""><strong>Some of your work involved object recognition rather than <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/image-recognition"" target=""_self"">image recognition</a>. Why?</strong></p><p><strong>Stylianou: </strong>The [NCMEC] analysts that use our tool have shared with us that oftentimes, in the query, all they can see is one object in the background and they want to run a search on just that. But when these models that we train typically operate on the scale of the full image, that’s a problem. </p><p>And there are things in a hotel that are unique and things that aren’t. Like a white bed in a hotel is totally non-discriminative. Most hotels have a white bed. But a really unique piece of artwork on the wall, even if it’s small, might be really important to recognizing the location. </p><p>[NCMEC analysts] can sometimes only see one object, or know that one object is important. Just zooming in on it in the types of models that we’re already using doesn’t work well. How could we support that better? We’re doing things like training object-specific models. You can have a couch model and a lamp model and a carpet model.</p><p><a href=""#top"">Back to top</a></p><p id=""success""><strong>How do you evaluate the success of the algorithm?</strong></p><p><strong>Stylianou: </strong>I have two versions of this answer. One is that there’s no real world dataset that we can use to measure this, so we create proxy datasets. We have our data that we’ve collected via the TraffickCam app. We take subsets of that and we put big blobs into them that we erase and we measure the fraction of the time that we correctly predict what hotel those are from. </p><p>So those images look as much like the victim images as we can make them look. That said, they still don’t necessarily look exactly like the victim images, right? That’s as good of a sort of quantitative metric as we can come up with.</p><p>And then we do a lot of work with the [NCMEC] to understand how the system is working for them. We get to hear about the instances where they’re able to use our tool successfully and not successfully. Honestly, some of the most useful feedback we get from them is them telling us, “I tried running the search and it didn’t work.”</p><p><strong>Have positive hotel image matches actually been used to help trafficking victims?</strong> </p><p><strong>Stylianou: </strong>I always struggle to talk about these things, in part because I have young kids. This is upsetting and I don’t want to take things that are the most horrific thing that will ever happen to somebody and tell it as our positive story. </p><p>With that said, there are cases we’re aware of. There’s one that I’ve heard from the analysts at NCMEC recently that really has reinvigorated for me why I do what I do.</p><p>There was a case of a live stream that was happening. And it was a young child who was being assaulted in a hotel. NCMEC got alerted that this was happening. The analysts who have been trained to use TraffickCam took a screenshot of that, plugged it into our system, got a result for which hotel it was, sent law enforcement, and were able to rescue the child. </p><p>I feel very, very lucky that I work on something that has real world impact, that we are able to make a difference. </p><p><a href=""#top"">Back to top</a></p>",IEEE Spectrum,https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss,Biotechnology,Biotechnology,N/A,N/A,"Computer vision, Law enforcement tools, Artificial intelligence, Hotels, Neural networks, Image recognition",30,True

In high-precision systems, particularly those involving lasers, even minor contamination of the optics can lead to component failure. While contaminants &mdash; either on a coating or at the interface with the substrate &mdash; can absorb laser energy and degrade the coating or substrate surface, the presence of dust, streaks, and/or stains scatters light, which reduces the overall functionality of the laser optic. Numerous studies have shown that the cleaning process alone can vary the laser damage threshold of a coated optic by as much as 75%. In addition to ensuring optimal optical performance, cleaning helps to prevent permanent damage to the component.<br /> <br /> At the...",Photonics Spectra,https://www.photonics.com/rss.aspx,Photonics,Photonics,N/A,N/A,N/A,25,True
